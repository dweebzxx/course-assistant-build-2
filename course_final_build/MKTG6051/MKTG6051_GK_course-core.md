## Course Syllabus
<!-- anchor: #course-syllabus -->

**Syllabus Overview:**

We will focus on developing rapid and actionable insights. We will do this by learning to form testable hypotheses, collect relevant data quickly, and perform fundamental analytics. Techniques may include qualitative research, survey design, sample design, online data collection, descriptive statistics, and tests for statistical significance. By the end of class, students will be able to provide convincing recommendations for common marketing decisions.

The course is most appropriate for people who focus on marketing strategy and management. It is also appropriate for people whose job functions involve working with market research and analytics professionals, who need to assess the quality of marketing research, and whose job requires them to work with, interpret, and take action based on data.

**Key Syllabus Points:**
- Focus on developing rapid and actionable insights
- Form testable hypotheses, collect relevant data quickly, perform fundamental analytics
- Techniques include qualitative research, survey design, sample design, online data collection, descriptive statistics, and statistical significance tests

**Syllabus Version:** Spring 2026

## Required Resources
<!-- anchor: #required-resources -->

### Textbooks

| Title | Author(s) | Edition | ISBN | Required/Optional |
|-------|-----------|---------|------|-------------------|
| None | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

There are no required textbooks for this class. All materials related to the course will be available on Canvas.

### Software and Technology

| Resource | Purpose | Access Instructions |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| Microsoft Excel | Data analysis | Required on personal computers |
| Microsoft Data Analysis Add-in | Data analysis add-in for Excel | Free, install on personal computers |
| R | Statistical analysis (later in semester) | No prior coding skills required |
| Canvas | Course management | university Canvas |

### Other Required Materials

- Students will need to analyze data using Excel on their own computers
- Students will need to install the Microsoft Data Analysis Add-in
- If not familiar with Excel, consider getting training with this tool

### Optional Course Materials

I recommend reading articles and books about decision making and biases because they will help you design persuasive marketing appeals. While academic articles are often more rigorous and detailed than books, popular books are generally more approachable and can synthesize multiple fields of study. Recommended authors include people like Ariely, Gilbert, Gladwell, Griskevicius, Kahneman, and Simonson. If you are looking for a place to start, I recommend *Predictably Irrational* by Dan Ariely.

### Academic Integrity Policy
<!-- anchor: #academic-integrity-policy -->

The Carlson School defines academic misconduct as any act by a student that misrepresents the student's own academic work or that compromises the academic work of another. Scholastic misconduct includes (but is not limited to) cheating on assignments or examinations, plagiarizing, i.e., misrepresenting as one's own work any work done by another, submitting the same paper, or substantially similar papers, to meet the requirement of more than one course without the approval and consent of the instructors concerned, or sabotaging another's work. Within this general definition, however, instructors determine what constitutes academic misconduct in the courses they teach. Students found guilty of academic misconduct face penalties ranging from lowering of the course grade or awarding a grade of F or N for the entire course, to suspension from the University.

Review the Student Conduct Code at https://z.umn.edu/policy-carlson_student_conduct_code and Student Conduct and Academic Integrity website at https://z.umn.edu/student_conduct_academic_integrity.

**AI Use Policy:** Artificial intelligence (AI) language models, such as ChatGPT, may be used for Research Exercise and the Final Project with appropriate citation, but not for quizzes. If you are in doubt as to whether you are using AI language models appropriately in this course, I encourage you to discuss your situation with me. Citations should be included with your submission and should describe exactly how you use the tool(s) for this course requirement. You are responsible for fact checking statements composed by AI language models.

### Accommodation Policy
<!-- anchor: #accommodation-policy -->

The University of Minnesota is committed to providing all students equal access to learning opportunities. The Disability Resource Center (DRC) is the campus office that works with students who have disabilities to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations. Students registered with the DRC, who have a letter requesting accommodations, are encouraged to contact the instructor early in the semester.
