## Course Syllabus
<!-- anchor: #course-syllabus -->

**Syllabus Overview:**

*"Wanting to lead and believing you can lead are the departure points on the path to leadership. Leadership is an art - a performing art - and the instrument is the self. The mastery of the art of leadership comes with the mastery of the self. Ultimately, leadership development is a process of self-development."* - The Leadership Challenge

*"We judge ourselves by our intentions. And others by their actions."* - Stephen R. Covey

Organizations spend billions of dollars each year on leadership training and development programs. Effective leadership is considered essential for organizations, though defining effective leadership is often ambiguous and always contextually-dependent. Enacting effective leadership practices presents an enormous challenge for most individuals. Our course's focus is to prepare and equip you to improve your confidence and capabilities to lead yourself, your projects, and others in the future.

We will do this by providing you with opportunities to deepen your understanding of effective leadership, examine where you are in your leadership development, and hone your skills. Although the course content is informed by leadership theory and empirical evidence, our focus centers on understanding your personal leadership strengths and vulnerabilities through feedback while developing your leadership skills through practice. The course is *interactive*. **If you want a course where you can sit back and just listen, this is not it**. All students will actively participate in discussions and exercises, practice leadership behaviors, reflect on their behaviors, chart ways to take action on their personal and professional priorities, and create a customized leadership development plan.

**Key Syllabus Points:**
- Focus on leadership development as self-development
- Interactive course requiring active participation
- 360-degree leadership assessment (LPI)
- Final deliverable is a Leadership Development Plan
- Three full-day intensive sessions

**Syllabus Version:** Spring 2025 A Term

## Course Policies
<!-- anchor: #course-policies -->

### Attendance Policy
<!-- anchor: #attendance-policy -->

By enrolling in this course, you are agreeing to attend all synchronous sessions. Because the course is compressed and requires students to be active participants, you should not enroll unless you are able to attend each of the sessions. Attendance at all sessions is required. **If you miss a session for any reason, your final grade in the course will be dropped by one full letter grade.**

**Summary:** Attendance at all sessions is mandatory; missing a session results in one full letter grade reduction.

### Participation Policy
<!-- anchor: #participation-policy -->

Participation is more than asking and responding to questions—it also includes evidence of preparation for class and active participation in discussions. For each class session, you should be prepared to summarize or talk about an assigned reading, describe your paper, answer questions posed by other students, etc.

Participation will be assessed in three ways at the end of the course:
1. Instructor Assessment
2. Peer Assessment via Peer Evaluations
3. Self-Assessment

### Late Work Policy
<!-- anchor: #late-work-policy -->

Any late work will have a grade reduced by one grade per day late (e.g. a paper one day late would drop from A to A-, two days late from A to B+).

If you wish to dispute any grade, you must do so in writing within one week of when the paper was returned. Include a specific rationale for why you are disputing the grade.

**Summary:** One grade reduction per day late (A to A-, then A- to B+, etc.)

### Academic Integrity Policy
<!-- anchor: #academic-integrity-policy -->

The Carlson School defines academic misconduct as any act by a student that misrepresents the student's own academic work or that compromises the academic work of another. Scholastic misconduct includes (but is not limited to) cheating on assignments or examinations, plagiarizing, i.e., misrepresenting as one's own work any work done by another, submitting the same paper or substantially similar papers, to meet the requirement of more than one course without the approval and consent of the instructors concerned, or sabotaging another's work.

Review the Student Conduct Code at https://z.umn.edu/policy-carlson_student_conduct_code and Student Conduct and Academic Integrity website at https://z.umn.edu/student_conduct_academic_integrity.

**AI Use Policy:** Not specified in syllabus.

### Accommodation Policy
<!-- anchor: #accommodation-policy -->

The University of Minnesota is committed to providing all students equal access to learning opportunities. The Disability Resource Center (DRC) is the campus office that works with students who have disabilities to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations. Students registered with the DRC who have a letter requesting accommodations are encouraged to contact the instructor early in the semester. Students who have, or think they may have, a disability (e.g. psychiatric, attention, learning, vision, hearing, physical, or systemic), are invited to contact the DRC for a confidential discussion at 612-626-1333 (V/TTY) or at drc@umn.edu. Additional information is available on the Disability Resource Center website at https://z.umn.edu/disability_resource_center.
