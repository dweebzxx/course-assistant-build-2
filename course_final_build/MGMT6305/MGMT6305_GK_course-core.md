## Course Syllabus
<!-- anchor: #course-syllabus -->

**Syllabus Overview:**

The International Environment of Business ("IEB") course is about the external challenges confronting managers and firms competing internationally. The paradigmatic firms of interest in this course are large established multinational corporations ("MNEs") and smaller ones just starting to internationalize their operations. Both compete internationally and both need to manage international legal, political, and social dynamics affecting survival and success.

MNEs often do that differently. An MNE typically owns or controls significant resources and operations in several, often disparate countries, cultures and markets. MNE performance depends on internal and external income streams denominated in multiple currencies. The MNE has operations situated in localities with different and often conflicting legal, political, and social policy priorities.

The overall theme of the IEB course is understanding MNEs and different types of external factors shaping their behavior and performance. We'll answer these questions: Why do firms go abroad? Why do they do so as MNEs? How are MNEs typically structured? How do they compete with other foreign and domestic firms? What legal, political, and social factors shape MNE behavior and performance generally? How do great MNEs manage those factors, perhaps even turn them into advantages?

**Key Syllabus Points:**
- Focus on multinational corporations (MNEs) and international business environment
- Case analysis as the primary teaching tool
- Six modules covering foundations, legal, political, social environments, simulation, and company reports
- Emphasis on "reading, saying, and doing" (case studies, discussions, and role-playing)

**Syllabus Version:** Spring 2026

## Course Description
<!-- anchor: #course-description -->

The International Environment of Business ("IEB") course is about the external challenges confronting managers and firms competing internationally. The activities of many firms have an international element. But the paradigmatic firms of interest in this course are large established multinational corporations ("MNEs") and smaller ones just starting to internationalize their operations. Both compete internationally and both need to manage international legal, political, and social dynamics affecting survival and success.

This course uses case analysis as the primary teaching tool. Cases are drawn from varied industrial contexts including aircraft manufacturers and airlines, consumer electronics, mining, and automobiles, as well as welding, waste disposal, metal engraving, coffee. They come from varied country contexts such as the US, Western Europe and Japan, but also from developing countries in Latin America, the Middle East, and Sub-Saharan Africa.

There is no textbook for the IEB course. All readings are listed in the syllabus and will be made available via electronic links at Canvas or in a case and readings packet.

### Optional Course Materials

If you are looking for a text to "bone-up" on general management issues, I like Robert Grant's *Contemporary Strategy Analysis* (Blackwell Publishers). Any recent edition will do. It is available via Amazon.com or other online booksellers.

## Course Policies
<!-- anchor: #course-policies -->

### Attendance Policy
<!-- anchor: #attendance-policy -->

Class participation constitutes a significant portion of the course grade. It is important because it provides the instructor with the best and most frequent indication that you have prepared for class. Second, it is important because your participation in class discussion teaches others.

For both reasons you need to make every reasonable effort to be in class on time and well prepared. If you are absent from class without telling the instructor in advance, or unless you missed because of a medical or family emergency, your participation grade will suffer.

**Summary:** Attendance is required; come prepared and on time; unexcused absences affect participation grade.

### Participation Policy
<!-- anchor: #participation-policy -->

This course relies heavily on case materials. Analysis and discussion of different international business contexts is the primary activity in class meetings. Individual preparation and participation are, therefore, essential to the success of the class.

In grading class participation, the instructor will look at both the quantity and quality of contributions. The instructor has never penalized someone for speaking up too often. More has almost always been better. However, you should try to include others.

Quality criteria include:
- Whether the points raised are relevant to the discussion
- Whether the points raised go beyond a mere recitation of case facts
- Whether the points raised show evidence of analysis rather than mere expression of opinions
- Whether the points raised build on points raised by others in the class
- Whether the points raised contribute further to the class understanding

### Late Work Policy
<!-- anchor: #late-work-policy -->

Not explicitly specified in syllabus. Due dates for assignments are specified in the course schedule.

**Summary:** Not specified; follow course schedule for due dates.

### Academic Integrity Policy
<!-- anchor: #academic-integrity-policy -->

You are expected to do your own academic work and cite sources as necessary. Failing to do so is scholastic dishonesty. Scholastic dishonesty means plagiarizing; cheating on assignments or examinations; engaging in unauthorized collaboration on academic work; taking, acquiring, or using test materials without faculty permission; submitting false or incomplete records of academic achievement; acting alone or in cooperation with another to falsify records or to obtain dishonest grades, honors, awards, or professional endorsement; altering, forging, or misusing a University academic record; or fabricating or falsifying data, research procedures, or data analysis. If it is determined that a student has cheated, the student may be given an "F" or an "N" for the course, and may face additional sanctions from the University.

**AI Use Policy:** Not specified in syllabus.

### Accommodation Policy
<!-- anchor: #accommodation-policy -->

The University is committed to providing quality education to all students regardless of disability. Determining appropriate disability accommodations is a collaborative process. You as a student must register with Disability Services and provide documentation of your disability. The course instructor must provide information regarding a course's content, methods, and essential components. The combination of this information will be used by Disability Services to determine appropriate accommodations for a particular student in a particular course. For more information, see the Board of Regents Policies located here: https://regents.umn.edu/policy/all.
