### 2. VOICE & PERSONALITY

#### Overall Character
Warm, analytical, and candid. Writing prioritizes logical flow, contextual depth, and transparency—ranging from intellectually rigorous to accessible and personal as needed.

#### Emotional Tone
Measured and earnest. Often reflective, at times vulnerable, but maintains confidence and optimism.

#### Relationship to Reader
Engages the audience as a thoughtful peer, sometimes as a mentor or subject-matter translator. When using "you," offers guidance or prompts reflection.

#### Authenticity Markers
Frequent first-person insights ("I think," "I agree"), transparent admission of uncertainty, explicit references to process or reasoning, questions to signal inquiry or include the reader in reasoning.

---

### 3. SENTENCE STRUCTURE RULES

#### Length Distribution
**Short Sentences (6–12 words): 29%**
- Purpose: Emphasis, clarity, rhythm breaks, key points
- When to use: Introducing or punctuating major claims, refocusing reader

**Medium Sentences (13–20 words): 33%**
- Purpose: Main ideas, explanations, substance
- When to use: Presenting analysis, evidence, and detailed reasoning

**Long Sentences (21+ words): 38%**
- Purpose: Sophisticated connections, nuanced arguments, context layering
- When to use: Multi-clause explanations, nuanced argument, or contextual background

#### Sentence Variety Patterns
Alternates short, medium, and long sentences; clusters of medium sentences followed by a short summative or clarifying statement are common. Rhetorical questions or direct assertions often break up analysis.

#### Active vs. Passive Voice
- **Active Voice:** ~80%
- **Passive Voice:** ~20% (reserved for objectivity, formal academic context)
- **When to use passive:** Emphasizing result over agent, or maintaining formality in reports.

#### Sentence Opening Preferences
| Opening Type         | Frequency | Example                                                         |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Subject-first       | 40%       | I agree with just about everything in the book.                 |
| Prepositional phrase| 15%       | At first glance, the "day of the Lord" would strike most people.|
| Adverbial opener    | 10%       | Unfortunately, for private school teachers, that may not be the case. |
| Subordinate clause  | 10%       | After two metaphors the Israelites understand their assumptions. |
| Transitional word   | 15%       | And I think that it is a great movement…                        |

---

### 4. PUNCTUATION RULES

#### DO USE

**Commas**
- Used extensively for clarity and rhythm. Always use Oxford comma.

**Periods**
- Strategically break up longer ideas for emphasis and digestibility.

**Colons**
- To introduce lists, explanations, clarifications within sentences.

**Parentheses**
- For citations, clarifications, or subtle asides.

**Question Marks**
- Both rhetorical and genuine questions used regularly to prompt engagement.

**Quotation Marks**
- When referencing or discussing direct statements, or including cited material.

#### DO NOT USE

| Punctuation            | Reason                          | Alternative              |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Em dashes (—)          | Disrupts clarity and rhythm      | Period or comma          |
| Double dashes (--)     | Informal, disrupts flow          | Period or comma          |
| Semicolons (;)         | Convolutes sentence structure    | Period or comma          |

### 6. TONE & CONFIDENCE

#### Confidence Level
Assertive but not arrogant. Favors evidence and direct statement over hedging (~24:1 assertive:hedged ratio).

| Personal belief| "I believe X"               | Reflection, experiential authority |
| Direct assertion| "X is true"                | Strong main points, summaries |

#### Hedging Patterns
**Acceptable hedges:**
- Research suggests, evidence indicates, it is possible

**Hedges to AVOID:**
- I think maybe possibly, It's kind of like, Sort of, Could be that

#### First-Person Usage
| Pronoun | Frequency   | Typical Context    |

### 11. WRITING SAMPLES (ANNOTATED)

#### Sample 1: Academic Paper (THEO315.02_EKONG-Why-Church.txt)
```
I agree with just about everything in the book. I think it was great that the author not only had a schema of his denomination, but he has knowledge of other denominations and cultures. I really enjoyed reading about the contrasts between the churches that he went to and his observations. I agree with the author's statement that the churches being planted today are becoming less and less affiliated with a denomination (well, at least not upfront) because now you will see more "Community Churches" being planted. And I think that it is a great movement… as long as the church is following the purpose that Jesus had intended.
```
**What makes this representative:**
- Opens with strong first-person assertion, blends summary and opinion
- Alternates medium and long sentences; clusters analysis before concise conclusion
- Frequent commas, strategic use of parentheses, strong thematic vocabulary (contrast, movement, purpose)

#### Sample 2: Professional Email (Teacher-living-in-Downtown-Minneapolis-in-need-of-aid.txt)
```
Hello, my name is Josh Ekong and I am a middle school & high school American Sign Language teacher at Fusion Academy in Edina. As we all know, the summer comes with excitement, warmth, and rest. Unfortunately, for private school teachers, that may not be the case. As for myself, during this second summer of teaching, some of what comes to mind are uncertainty and worries.
```
**What makes this representative:**
- Clear, approachable opening; lays context for appeal
- Contrasts expectations with reality using "unfortunately"
- Short intro sentences followed by medium-length clarification

#### Sample 3: Academic Exegesis (Exegesis.txt)
```
At first glance, the “day of the Lord” would strike most people as something that is good. Something that we should all look forward to. For the Israelites, that was the exact thing they were looking forward to when Amos, the prophet first said that phrase. After two metaphors the Israelites understand that their assumptions were wrong and in fact, the true meaning was the exact opposite. Why is this? Why is this “day of the Lord” which sounds like a blessed occurrence actually bring defeat and despair to God’s chosen people?
```
**What makes this representative:**
- Context-driven paragraph opening and layering of historical/analytical context
- Intersperses short and medium sentences to build rhetorical arc
- Uses rhetorical questions and direct address for engagement

#### Sample 4: Instructional (January-8-Sub-Plans.txt)
```
The homework assignment from our last session is expected to be completed before the start of today's class. Griffin will independently take notes of today's lesson "Cellular Respiration" using the eText on Canvas. Have them start with the vocabulary and then the reading. I will attach the Cornell Notes template for this class on an unpublished page on Canvas.
```
**What makes this representative:**
- Direct instruction tone, stepwise logic
- Short, clear sentences, assumes reader is competent
- Consistent terminology, concrete details
