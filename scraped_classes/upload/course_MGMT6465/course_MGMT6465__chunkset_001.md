I am happy to answer questions and discuss any issues or ideas you may have. To enable this, I will try to be available as much as possible during our synchronous class sessions and at the end of each day to briefly discuss anything that would be helpful for your career and leadership development. If you would like to have a lengthier chat or focused discussion, let’s set up a time. Please book time with me directly via Calendly by scheduling a slot that works for you (we’ll both automatically receive a calendar invite with a Zoom link): [https://calendly.com/campbele/30minLinks to an external site.](https://calendly.com/campbele/30min). If the slots available for students do not work for you, please email me with several proposed alternatives (including Saturday or Sunday, if need be).

**REFLECTION EXERCISE, Challenge the Process--Practicing Outsight**

*(Recall that you can do this OR the other Challenge the Process reflection; pick which best serves your development)*

* *Take a few minutes to reflect, then answer each question below.**You may reference and resubmit content after initial submission.*
* *As with all of our course's reflection exercises, taking time to think and organize your thoughts is what is most valuable. These are all designed as notes for your development, not my own reading/grading. The more thoughtful your reflection and answers, the more likely it is that these thought exercises will help you plan and write your final Leadership Development Plan.*
* *You should share and capture in prose (or bullet points) what best serves you. Prompts are to encourage growth without pushing you to share more than you want.  Using GenAI on prompts would be an "interesting choice"—if an individual were outsourcing their introspection and leadership development to a robot, would you hire them? GPT might hire them, but you shouldn't.*

**1. Your inputs.** It is commonly noted that leaders are ***always on the lookout*** for new sources of information, novel ideas, and creative insights. How do you get your information? List your top 4–5 most common sources of ideas/information (people, meetings, media, mentors, data, etc.). For each, note: a) What it’s good for; b) One blind spot it might create (what it causes you to miss)

**2. Your outsight gaps.** Identify 2–3 perspectives you rarely access that could challenge your default thinking (e.g., customers/end users, frontline employees, skeptics/critics, competitors, adjacent industries, people unlike you).

**3. Outsight list (specific sources).** Write 5 specific “outside your routine” sources you could tap (people or places). For each, include: a) Who/where; b) One question you’d ask; c) What you hope to learn

**4. One assumption to test.** Name one assumption you’re carrying (about your work/project/career/team/leadership). What evidence supports it? What would disconfirm it? Which outsight source above could test it fastest?

**5. Commit (next ~14 days)**. Choose one outsight action you will actually take in the next two weeks. Specify: a) What you’ll do + when; b) The 1–2 questions you’ll ask; b) How you’ll capture what you learn (3 bullets, notes, voice memo).

This is an evidence-based detailed assessment. I highly recommend taking this online survey on a computer (i.e., not a phone) and in one sitting. Do not preview it but rather sit down and take it when you have 15-20 uninterrupted minutes to answer questions thoughtfully and honestly about your personality, work preferences, and behaviors at work. This assessment has been developed by the Carlson Leadership Development team and made free to you. Your responses will directly feed several reports you will receive during the course.

**REFLECTION EXERCISE, Updating Your Notions of Leadership**

*(After watching Part 1 and Part 2 of the Leadership Foundations videos, reflect and take a few minutes to answer each of the below questions and submit your answers online.**You may reference and resubmit content after initial submission. Thoughtful answers are likely to help you craft a more valuable final Leadership Development paper).*

1. What did you learn from the concepts overviewed that sharpened or helped update or refine your understanding of leadership development? Reference a specific idea discussed that challenged you, surprised you, or sharpened your thinking.

2. Reflecting on your individual characteristics and default tendencies, what factors may help or hinder your leadership ***emergence***? What conditions help you ***show up*** as a leader?

**Final Leadership Development Plan**

Other assignments in the course pave the way for this, our big-ticket deliverable. The purpose of your Final Leadership Development paper is to chart a longer-term vision and short-term roadmap for your personal development. This should be the most valuable assignment for you and represent something that serves you long after the course ends. It takes the form of one paper comprised of three parts. Below are several strong exemplar papers. So that you can clearly understand how to structure your paper and how it will be evaluated, I have written a detailed overview, which also contains the grading rubric: [Final Leadership Development Plan.pdf](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/544866/files/57964863?verifier=f4zBmXniokoomJ9p7lysoD4UyqhMjX0gD5htzV50&wrap=1 "Final Leadership Development Plan.pdf")

Please upload your Final Leadership Development Paper as one document. Part C (leadership legacy slides) can be included in that document or uploaded separately (i.e., as PDF or PPT). I have enabled you to upload two documents.

*Note: In prior terms, there was a Time-Use Assessment and a corresponding write-up/analysis. Due to the compressed nature of the term and to reduce students' pre-work responsibilities given all that has been going on, this part of the assignment has been omitted this term.*

Deadline Options:

From years of teaching this course, I have learned that students tend to segment into two groups: those who prefer to submit early and get their grade more swiftly (e.g., for potential employer course reimbursement), and those who favor a later date since they are particularly busy this month (i.e., with other courses and commitments, travel, etc.). Consequently, I have two due dates for your Final Leadership Development Plan, which you can elect based on preference.

Early Submission Deadline: Monday, 3/9 (by 11:59pm)

Extended Submission Deadline: Fri, 3/13 (by 11:59pm)

**REFLECTION EXERCISE: Leveling Up Our Growth & Self-Awareness with Vulnerability**

* *Take a few minutes to first reflect and then answer each of the questions below.* *You may reference and resubmit content after initial submission.*
* *As with all of our course's reflection exercises, taking time to think and organize your thoughts is what is most valuable. These are all designed as notes for your development, not my own reading/grading. The more thoughtful your reflection and answers, the more likely it is that these thought exercises will help you plan and write your final Leadership Development Plan.*
* *You should share and capture in prose (or bullet points) what best serves you. Prompts are to encourage growth without pushing you to share more than you want.*

1. **Leadership development & vulnerability.** What idea from Dr. Brown's classic TEDx talk hit you the most, and why might it matter for leadership development specifically? Name one leadership behavior that becomes harder when projecting invulnerability?

2. **Feigning invulnerability.** Where do you tend to armor up professionally (e.g., perfectionism, staying vague, people-pleasing, always being ‘fine’)? What does that armor protect you from? What does it cost you (opportunities, relationships, learning speed, energy)? How has that impacted your professional opportunities, career path, and/or day-to-day work?

3. **Vulnerability boundaries.** What seems like “appropriate vulnerability” for you in a professional setting? What is not appropriate for you—and why? How do you decide what to share and with whom? What would “10% more brave” look like without oversharing?

* *You should share and capture in prose (or bullet points) what best serves you. Prompts are to encourage growth without pushing you to share more than you want.*

**1. Recognizing tension to navigate conflict.** Where have you felt the tension Dr. Sah describes (i.e., when your instinct to comply or be conflict-avoidant collided with a deeper value)? Briefly describe the situation (work/school/home), who was involved, and what you did in the moment (e.g., stayed silent, went along, softened your message, changed the subject, spoke up boldly).

**2. Surfacing our values.** What value(s) were being activated for you in that moment? What specifically about the situation felt misaligned with that value?

**3. Agency in conflict.** Identify one person, relationship, or recurring context where you most often feel this tension. What is one small, values-aligned action you could prepare yourself to take (e.g., a question you could ask or a sentence you could say) that challenges the moment without escalating the conflict?

*\*\*Be prepared to discuss these in class in our Managing Conflict module\*\**

* **Peak moment**: When did you feel most proud/energized?
* **Evidence**: What specifically happened that made it meaningful?

**2) Surface value signals (**i.e., what mattered underneath). List 3–5 signals from that experience that point to what you valued---what made it good. *For example, you might deduce that you really enjoy collaborating with others, that you like careful attention to detail, that you like creating and innovating, that you need to feel a sense of autonomy, that you value feeling empowered, trusted, or in control, that you love when groups work efficiently without drama, etc.*

**The Leadership Challenge****Initial Reflection**

*(to be submitted directly into Canvas; length guideline 750-1000 words)*

1. After reading Chapter 1 of The Leadership Challenge with particular attention to competencies that map to the ***five leadership practices*.**
2. Identify the practice that you believe reflects your ***current top leadership strength.***
   * Describe the specific practice you chose and demonstrate to me that you understand this practice.
   * Describe how it manifests in your case, providing *evidence* (i.e., behavioral, communication, and actions that others can see) that this is a strength for you. Be specific – describe observable actions or patterns of your behavior, describe situations where you have used this strength, or report on feedback that you have received from others on this strength.

3. Identify the practice that you believe reflects your ***current top leadership weakness.***
   * Describe the specific practice you chose and demonstrate to me that you understand this practice.
   * Describe how it manifests in your case, providing *evidence* that this is a weakness for you. Be specific – describe observable actions or patterns of your behavior, describe situations where you ran into trouble because of your low skill in this area, or report on feedback that you have received from others on this weakness.

While reflecting upon and detailing your leadership strength and weakness—and the behavioral patterns driving them, I encourage you to:

* Reflect on our first set of class discussions and the results of your personality and coachability reports. How do your personality and related default tendencies serve and/or detract from your influence as a leader?
* Consider how your strengths and weaknesses may be linked. Are there aspects of your leadership style that impact both your strengths and weaknesses?

***Note: Stay in the present and detail where you are right now. Avoid judging yourself and thinking about where you “should be.” Instead, focus on identifying where you are right now regarding the leadership practices.***

Please take time to understand the assignment submission details. Do **NOT** write your reflection as a Google Doc and submit a link.

You are required to complete an online 360-degree leadership assessment. Please do this first—and start ASAP. This serves as the backbone of our course and will guide you through a self-assessment of your leadership behaviors. You must have at least six other individuals complete a survey about your behaviors. You may invite as many people as you wish, but six respondents reflect the minimum. **Not all respondents will respond, so I encourage you to invite at least eight (more is better).** I recommend that you invite a diverse set of colleagues—anyone who has had the opportunity to observe your behavior in a group, team, or leadership situation (e.g., current job, project teams, coaches, mentors, perhaps past jobs, volunteer or service organizations, or others who have had the opportunity to observe your work behaviors). If you have direct reports, ask them first. You will definitely want their feedback. You should also consider asking peers and your manager(s). I leave it to your judgment as to which individuals can best help sharpen your awareness of your current leadership style and skills. The only criterion is that they have had the opportunity to observe your leadership and influence behaviors—remember, engaging in leadership behaviors does not require having formal authority.

Like all high-quality 360-degree leadership assessments, there is a cost associated with the assessment ($160, which already reflects a 20% off UMN rate I negotiated). I understand that this is not cheap! Accordingly, I was mindful of cost when selecting the remainder of the required assessments/textbooks/materials and chose/developed free versions of other exercises and assessments. And because you are paying for this assessment, please make the most of it by getting started early and inviting ample respondents. Get your money’s worth!

Details for this assignment and how to sign up online for the assessment are attached. **Read the below instructions carefully and pay careful attention to the highlighted PIN and promo code, which links your assessments to our class.** Once you sign up, complete your assessment and select respondents immediately. This process, including your own self-assessment takes only about 10-20 minutes. I encourage you to do it when you have a little bit of headspace to reflect on your own behaviors and style—**as you *are*, not as you think you *should be***. Note: I will gently remind your observers who have yet to complete the assessment by their deadline.

**REFLECTION EXERCISE, Challenge the Process--Daring Greatly**

*(Recall that you can do this OR the other Challenge the Process reflection; pick which best serves your development)*

* *Take a few minutes to reflect, then answer each question below.**You may reference and resubmit content after initial submission.*
* *As with all of our course's reflection exercises, taking time to think and organize your thoughts is what is most valuable. These are all designed as notes for your development, not my own reading/grading. The more thoughtful your reflection and answers, the more likely it is that these thought exercises will help you plan and write your final Leadership Development Plan.*

*You should share and capture in prose (or bullet points) what best serves you. Prompts are to encourage growth without pushing you to share more than you want.  Using GenAI on prompts would be an "interesting choice"—if an individual were outsourcing their introspection and leadership development to a robot, would you hire them? GPT might hire them, but you shouldn't.*

**1. Identify a daring failure**. Think of a time you put yourself out there, and it didn’t work (work or personal). Briefly capture: (a) What you attempted and why it mattered; b) What the outcome was; c) How you responded in the moment (what you did/said next), and d) One lesson you’d want your future self to remember (and one behavior you’d repeat or change next time)

**2. Audit your perceived constraints.** (“We can’t because…”). List the likely “We can’t do this because…” statements that could constrain your project/work (e.g., time, staffing, politics, risk, priorities, stakeholders, capabilities). Write 5-7 statements as they would realistically be said out loud.

**3. Reality check (+ / –)**. Now, go back through your list and mark each statement:

* (+) actually true/hard constraint (at least for now)
* (–) not fully true, uncertain, or challengeable
  *(If helpful: add (?) for “I don’t know yet”)*

**4. Challenge your assumptions and surface potential solutions.** Choose 2–3 “–” statements to challenge (turn constraints into experiments). For the 2–3 most important challengeable constraints, write:

* The statement: “We can’t because \_\_\_.”
* The hidden assumption underneath it: “This assumes \_\_\_.”
* A better question to replace it: “How might we \_\_\_ despite \_\_\_?”
* One small experiment you could run to test it (a conversation, pilot, prototype, data check, stakeholder ask)

**5. Commit (next ~14 days).** Choose one experiment from above that you will actually run in the next two weeks. Specify: a) What you’ll do + when; b) Who you’ll involve (or who you’ll ask); c) The 1–2 questions you’ll ask; and d) How you’ll capture what you learn (3 bullets, notes, voice memo).

**Class/Group Contribution & Professionalism.** Your contribution grade will be based on your ***active*** and ***thoughtful*** contributions. Contribution requires more than asking and responding to questions—it also includes evidence of preparation for class and active participation in discussions. For each class, you should be prepared to summarize an assigned reading, describe your paper/answers to an assignment,  answer questions posed by other students, etc. Regardless of whether I am lecturing, we are engaging in group activities or discussions, guest lecturers are presenting, or your classmates are interjecting their ideas, I expect that you will actively listen, comment, solicit the viewpoints of others. Many of you may have relevant personal experiences that could benefit all of us. I encourage you to share these during class. Participation will be assessed in three ways at the end of the course (links to online assessment will be distributed):

1. 1. 1. Course & Instructor Assessment
      2. Peer Assessment via Peer Evaluations
      3. Self-Assessment

**REFLECTION EXERCISE, Big Picture Legacy**

* *Take a few minutes to reflect, then answer each question below.**You may reference and resubmit content after initial submission.*
* *As with all of our course's reflection exercises, taking time to think and organize your thoughts is what is most valuable. These are all designed as notes for your development, not my own reading/grading. The more thoughtful your reflection and answers, the more likely it is that these thought exercises will help you plan and write your final Leadership Development Plan.*

Good news! I’m not going to make you write your obituary! (Though it is another well-worn leadership development tool that prompts people to consider how they want to inspire). However, I do want you to think about ***the last chapter of your life***. Picture your ***retirement party***. I want you to think about the person who is ***giving the speech*** about your ***career,*** your ***impact,*** your ***leadership legacy***. What do you hope they say? What do you want to be known for? What do you want your leadership legacy to be?

Write whatever comes to mind, even if it feels like stream-of-consciousness. Use words, phrases, bullets, or sentences. Don’t overthink this exercise. Just listen to yourself and do not overedit, censor, analyze, or critique your thoughts. I'm not going to scrutinize or sort through these. The reflection work is for you and, ultimately, for your final Leadership Development paper.

Take 10 minutes to complete this.  You can revisit it later, so do not try to think too hard or to perfect your answer now. This is a well-worn, powerful thought exercise that can ***help you surface your "why", prompt some forward-thinking, and spark some prospection on how you would like to be remembered.***
