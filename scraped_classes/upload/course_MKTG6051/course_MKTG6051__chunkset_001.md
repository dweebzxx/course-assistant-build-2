Define a problem that is optimally addressed by qualitative research. ***Develop a realistic plan that you will actually execute***. Your plan should include:

* Problem definition
* Explanation why your qualitative technique is optimal to address this problem
* Example of findings or results (e.g., quotes, figures, charts)
* Logistics (execution dates, locations, compensation plan if any, plan for pretesting)
* Appendix with research documents (e.g., screener, discussion guide, any other materials)

You can recruit participants a number of ways. Make sure to justify appropriateness of the sample both for research purposes and practicality.

* Convenience sample - friends/classmates
* Posters - around/off-campus
* Social media advertisement
* Customer observation (store, at home, online)
* etc.

This quiz is different from the rest of the quizzes we'll have this term in that I'm primarily looking for your opinions. I will ask you some questions about the group project. Don't start the quiz until after you've had a chance to review the syllabus and group project guidelines. You'll have 30 minutes to complete the quiz, but you can probably complete it much faster.
