## Part 2. ER Modeling / Normalization

### 8. Lucy's Play School

Lucy's Playschool is a child day care center. The play school keeps track of each child's contact person, anergies, and rooms they are assigned to, and employees who work in these rooms.

* For each child, it tracks information including name, age, gender, birthday, and allergies. You may treat allergies as a single atomic field.
* Each child must have an adult contact person. It saves information including the contact person's contact phone number, and address (including street, city, state, and zip code). Each child has one adult as his/her contact person but an adult can be a contact person for multiple children (e.g. one family may enroll multiple kids in the center).
* The center has several rooms of different sizes. Each room has a room number, a designated capacity, and an assigned age group (infant, toddler, kid, pre-teen). For example, rooms 2 and 3 are for infants and room 4 is for toddlers.
* A child is assigned to a room based on his/her age and availability of space. Each child is assigned to one room. Each room may be assigned to multiple children. But the room may also be vacant (when the enrollment is low).
* A room may be managed by one or more employees. An employee can manage at most one room. Some employees do not manage any room (e.g. the reception desk employee).
* The center keeps track of each employee's name, phone number, education, and gender

Based on the above description, Develop an ER Diagram for Lucy's Play School using MySQL workbench.

* You may ignore the data types for now.
* If you make any assumptions, please state them explicitly.

# MABA 6321 Lab 4: Modeling Data with ER Diagrams

In this lab, we will practice creating ER diagram using MySQL Workbench, as well as identifying entities, attributes, and relationships based on the given business description.

### 1. Consulting contracts

Create an ER diagram using **MySQL Workbench** based on the following description.

* The `consulting contracts` database has three entities: `consultants`, `companies`, and `contracts`.
* `Consultants` has three attributes: `consultant_id`, `consultant_name`, and `specialties`, where `consultant_id` is its primary key (PK).
* `Companies` has three attributes also: `company_id`, `company_name`, and `industry_type`, where the first one is the PK.
* `Contracts` has six attributes:`contract_id`, `company_id`, `consultant_id`, `contract_date`, `hourly_rate`, and `hours`, where the first one is the PK, and the second and third are PKs.

You may assume that all relationships are mandatory on both sides.

### 2. Sports Goods

The Sports Goods sales system maintains detailed records of employees, customers, orders, and products.

* For each customer, it maintains information such as name, address, city, state, zip code, and phone number. Each customer is uniquely identified by a CustomerID.
* Each order is uniquely identified by an OrderNo and includes the order date and total amount. Every order is associated with exactly one customer and one employee, indicating who placed the order and who handled it. The employees involved in the sales process are identified by an EmployeeID and have attributes such as first name, last name, and job title.
* Each order may include multiple products. For each product in an order, the system captures the quantity and purchase price. Each product is identified by a ProdID and includes descriptive attributes such as product name, group (or category), wholesale and retail prices, and the number of units currently on hand.

Create an ER diagram using **MySQL Workbench** based on the above business requirements. If you identify a many-to-many relationship, please convert it to a one-to-many relationships with an associative entity.

---
### 3. **Fraud Detection**

You are tasked with designing the database for a digital financial services platform that provides online payment and transaction services to a growing user base. The platform allows users to register accounts, log in from different devices, make financial transactions, and make payments using various methods. A critical business requirement is the ability to monitor user activity for fraud detection and generate appropriate reports for high-risk transactions.

Each user on the platform has a unique identifier and associated metadata, such as the date the account was created, the most recent login date, the current account status, and a cumulative count of past transactions. The platform supports device-based logins, meaning that users may interact with the platform using one or more devices, each uniquely identified by a device ID and specified by device type and MAC address.

All transactions are tracked with detailed logs that include the user involved, the transaction amount, the type of transaction (e.g., deposit, withdrawal, purchase), the date, and the device and IP address from which it was made. Additional metadata such as geolocation and number of login attempts at the time of the transaction are also captured. This data is crucial for behavioral analysis and anomaly detection.

To mitigate financial risks, the system includes a fraud detection component. When a suspicious transaction is identified, it is logged in a fraud report, which records the type of fraud, a risk score, and the current resolution status. Each fraud report is linked to both the transaction in question and the user associated with it. This allows the platform to analyze fraudulent behavior across different users and transactions for audit or enforcement actions.

Finally, the platform tracks payments made by users. A user may have multiple payment records, each specifying the payment amount, payment method (e.g., credit card, PayPal), the last four digits of a payment card, and the payment status (e.g., successful, failed, pending). These records are used to manage and reconcile financial flows, support refunds, and maintain compliance with industry standards for transaction processing.

Create an ER diagram using **MySQL Workbench** based on the above business requirements. If you identify a many-to-many relationship, please convert it to a one-to-many relationships with an associative entity.

In this lab, we will focus on normalization and MySQL database design.

* It is recommended that you create a single google doc to hold answers for all three questions.

## Part 1: Normalization

For each problem below, transform the table(s) into a database design that satisfieds the 3rd normal form.

* Do so step by step - first check and satisfy the 1st normal form, then the 2nd normal form, and the third normal form.
* Please give each table an appropriate name that reflects its granularity and content.
* Please also mark each table's primary key fields with PK (or bold or underline).

### 1. employee training courses

In this example, we consider a business scenario where a corporation tracks employee participation in professional training courses. Originally, all the information is stored in one table, which leads to data redundancy and update anomalies. The initial table looks like this:

* **EmployeeTraining** (emp\_id, name, dept, salary, training\_course\_id, training\_date)

### 2. Online Retails Sales

Imagine you’re working with an e-commerce dataset that tracks sales transactions. The initial design is a single large table with order details, customer information, and product data, which leads to redundancy and potential data anomalies.

* **SalesData** (order\_id, order\_date, customer\_id, customer\_name, email, shipping\_address, product\_id, product\_name, unit\_price, quantity)

## Part 2. MySQL Database creation

### 3. Create a `SportsGoods` database

`sportsgood.mdb` is the MySQL workbench EER diagram we have created in the previous week. In this lab problem, we are going to create a database based on the EER model. We will then use generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT) to generate sample data and populate the database. Finally we will verify our database by creating a multi-table query.

* `sportsgood.mwb` was created with out much regard to the field data type. We now want to make these improvements before creating the database.

  + All the financial fields should use a `decimal(10,2)` data type.
  + Some fields should be integeter type (e.g. zip code, prodID, Onhands)
  + Data/Datetime fields should have `date` and `datetime` data types, respectively.
  + The database (schema) should be called `sportsgoods` instead of the default `mydb` (you can change it on the left panel, **Catalog Tree**).
  + Add a comment to the `onHand` field "Number of units on hand" (later on, this provide a hint to ChatGPT what this field is about; other fields are self-explanatory)
* Using **File**> **Export**> **Foreward Engeer SQL create script** to create and save an SQL script for table and database creation. Note that in the last step, you can use **save to Other file** to save the generated script to `sportsgoods.sql`.
* Execute `sportsgoods.sql` in MySQL workbench to create the database and tables.
* Using **GenAI** (e.g. **Copilot** or **ChatGPT**, free version is fine) to generate the insert data scripts. One prompt could be:

  + *I am going to provide a MySQL database creation script. Can you generate corresponding sample data for each table in the form of insert into SQL statements. Make sure the referential integration of the database is respected.*
  + Then, you can paste the sportsgoods.sql into the chatbot, when prompted.
  + Copy the resulting SQL insert scripts to a SQL file, and execute it to populated the database.
* Test your database with a multi-table query that select all tables and fields (with appropriate join conditions).

  + **Tip**: watch out for duplicate column names.

## SmartPAL App Activation

SmartPAL offers both a mobile app and a web app, accessible through a web browser. The web app does not require installation. We encourage you to install the mobile app because you can access it without using a PC.

### SmartPAL Mobile App Installation

Search 'SmartPAL' in the iOS App Store or Google Play Store and look for the owl icon wearing an academic cap to install the app.

If you have downloaded the app in a prior semester, please **check for any available update**, as older version of the App may not work well with newly enrolled courses.

### Sign In

Sign in with your **University email** or **SSO (Single Sign ON)** credentials. If using your email, create a user account the first time you log in.

After signing in, the app will display a list of participating courses you're enrolled in for the current semester. If no courses appear, it may be because (a) you're not enrolled in any participating course, or (b) your enrollment hasn't been synced with SmartPAL. If the issue persists, please contact SmartPAL support at **smartpal@umn.edu**.

On the mobile app, it will also ask you to enable *push notification*. We encourage you to **enable push notification** so that you will always keep updated.

## Earning Gems for Learning Engagement

The app uses gems as a fun way to track your engagement in the course. You can collect gems from four types of engagement activities:

* **Canvas Pageviews**: Each week, you can earn gems for being an active user of Canvas. A *pageview* means each time you click a Canvas link (such as an assignment, announcement, module, quiz). We track the number of pageviews you generate in the course and award gems based on the following rubric.:
  + 1 to 10 pageviews, you will receive 1 gem
  + 10 to 100 pageviews, you will receive 2 gems
  + 100+ page views, you will receive 3 gems
* **On-time Assignment Submissions**: You can earn gems each week by submitting assignments on time. For eligible assignments with due dates, gems are awarded based on the following rubric:
  + missed all assignments, you earn 0 gems.
  + Submitted at least one assignment (late or on time), 1 gem
  + Submitted an assignment on time, 2 gems.
  + Submitted all assignments on time, 3 gems.
  + No assignments that week, you automatically earn 3 gems.
* **Learning Reflections**: SmartPAL asks you to reflect on your learning every week.
  + Completing this week's reflection earns you 2 gems.
* **SmartPAL Engagement**: SmartPAL Engagement reflects how often you interact with the SmartPAL app. Each week, we measure engagement by counting the number of days you use the app. Based on this, you'll earn gems according to the following rubric.:
  + Using SmartPAL (mobile or web) on 1 day during the week earns you 1 gem.
  + Using SmartPAL (mobile or web) on 2 days during the week earns you 2 gems.
  + Using SmartPAL (mobile or web) on 3+ days during the week earns you 3 gems.

## Using Weekly Reflections to Enhance Your Learning and Instruction

Each week, SmartPAL will ask you to complete a quick reflection on your learning—what worked well and what was challenging. It only takes a few minutes and helps both you and your instructor improve your learning experience. You can earn gems by completing learning reflections as part of your SmartPAL Learning Engagement.

Complete your weekly reflections on the Mobile or Web App.

## Level Up

Earning gems helps you level up—your level rises after you've accumulated enough gems. We use the following rules to determine your level:

* Level 1 (Noob): 0-17 gems
* Level 2 (Pro): 18-47 gems
* Level 3 (Epic): >= 48 gems

## Leaderboard

We publish two leaderboards to celebrate the most engaged students in the course:

* **Weekly leaderboard**: based on the number of gems earned in the current week (starting from Sunday)
* **All-time leaderboard**: based on the total number of gems earned since the beginning of the course.

The leaderboard size is fixed at 5. If there is a tie (two or more students with the same number of gems), we include the one who has the most Canvas pageviews.

## How to use the SmartPAL Chatbot?

The built-in Chatbot uses generative AI to understand and answer questions. The chatbot can currently answer the following types of questions:

* Syllabus questions: e.g., what is the late policy?
* Logistics and planning questions: e.g., What is covered in quiz 2? What is planned for this week? What are latest announcements?
* Assignment questions: e.g. when is test X? what is my grade for the group project?
* Grading related questions: e.g. What is my grade for test X? what is my grade for the group project?
* SmartPAL related questions: e.g., How do I get engagement score on this app? How do I get more gems?
* Questions related to the course topics: Can you explain the concept of \_\_\_?

As this is a prototype chatbot, some responses may be incomplete or inaccurate. We appreciate your patience and understanding as it develops.

## Module 02: Overview

In this module, we will continue our journey on SQL and relational database. You will learn how to write **summary queries** using aggregate functions such as `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, and `MAX` to extract insights from datasets. We will also explore a variety of **SQL functions** that help you manipulate and analyze **numeric**, **textual**, and **datetime** values effectively. Additionally, this module will introduce the concept of **joining multiple tables** to answer more complex questions that require data from different sources. You’ll work with **inner joins**, **outer joins**, and understand how to combine data from related tables based on key relationships.

-- Problems for Video 4 --------------------------------

-- Note: for update/insert/delete queries, there are no result table. Instead you should copy and paste response as evidence of your completion of such a query.

-- ##11: We practice inserting rows in the following two steps.

-- Step 1: Add a new vendor to the vendors table with the following information.

-- vendor_id: 124
-- vendor_name: Land O' Lakes
-- vendor_address1: 4001 Lexington Ave N
-- vendor_city: Arden Hills
-- vendor_state: MN
-- vendor_zip_code: 55126
-- default_terms_id: 4
-- default_account_number: 580.

insert into vendors(vendor_id, vendor_name, vendor_address1, vendor_city, vendor_state, vendor_zip_code, default_terms_id, default_account_number)
values (124, "Land O' Lakes", '4001 Lexington Ave N', 'Arden Hills', 'MN', 55126,4,580);

-- 1 row(s) affected

-- Step 2: Then, verify by displaying the record for vendor_id 124.

select * from vendors where vendor_id=124;

-- # vendor_id, vendor_name, vendor_address1, vendor_address2, vendor_city, vendor_state, vendor_zip_code, vendor_phone, vendor_contact_last_name, vendor_contact_first_name, default_terms_id, default_account_number
-- 124, Land O' Lakes, 4001 Lexington Ave N, , Arden Hills, MN, 55126, , , , 4, 580

-- ##12: Delete the vendor with vendor_id 124 from the vendors table.

delete from vendors where vendor_id=124;

-- 1 row(s) affected

-- Problems for Video 5 --------------------------------

-- ##13: In the following, we will replace all nulls in vendor_address2 with empty string, and then reverse it.

-- Step 1: we verify that if there are any NULL values in vendor_address2

select * from vendors where  vendor_address2 is NULL;

-- 103 row(s) returned

-- Step 2: we verify that if there are any empty strings in vendor_address2

select * from vendors where  vendor_address2 ='';

-- 0 row(s) returned

-- Step 3: replace all nulls in vendor_address2 with empty string

-- Note: you may get an error: Error Code: 1175. You are using safe update mode and you tried to update a table without a WHERE that uses a KEY column.  To disable safe mode, toggle the option in Preferences -> SQL Editor and reconnect
-- Please follow the suggestion to toggle the Safe Mode to enable you to run a "unsafe" UPDATE query.

UPDATE vendors
SET vendor_address2 = ""
WHERE vendor_address2 IS NULL;

-- 103 row(s) affected Rows matched: 103  Changed: 103  Warnings: 0

-- Step 4: replace call empty strings in vendor_address2 with NULLs.

UPDATE vendors
SET vendor_address2 = NULL
WHERE vendor_address2 = "";

-- 103 row(s) affected Rows matched: 103  Changed: 103  Warnings: 0

-- The CTE approach is more readable and is also more computationally efficient since it does not need to compute largest\_order\_quanity over and over again for the same product.

## Module 03: Overview

This module marks the final installment of our SQL query series and introduces three advanced—but powerful—tools for writing more expressive and efficient queries: **subqueries**, **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**, and **window functions**. These techniques are essential for handling complex data manipulation tasks that go beyond basic filtering and aggregation.

### Learning Objectives

* Understand and apply **subqueries** to filter/augment data.
* Write and use **Common Table Expressions** (**CTEs**) to modularize SQL logic and build layered queries.
* Use **window functions** to compute rankings, cumulative totals, moving averages, and row-level comparisons.
* Differentiate between subqueries, JOINs, and CTEs and determine when each approach is appropriate.

## Module 04: Overview

In this module, you’ll be introduced to the Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram—a powerful visual tool for data modeling. We’ll explore its key components and best practices for designing data structures. ER diagrams will help you understand, communicate, and organize data more effectively, laying the foundation for building well-structured relational databases. Together with the next module, this will provide a complete view of how to optimally structure your data for storage and analysis.

### Learning Objectives

* Describe the purpose and key components of Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)
* Identify and define different types of attributes and apply best practices in modeling them
* Design ER diagrams with correct use of primary keys, foreign keys, cardinality
* Apply general guidelines to create clear, accurate, and practical ERDs based on real-world scenarios.

# MABA 6321 Homework 1 - SQL (solution)

## Part 1: Short Answers

1. Explain the following concepts in one or two sentences.

* **DBMS**: refers to a general-purpose software system that facilitates the processes of defining, creating, using and maintaining databases
* **Primary Key**: A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each row in that table.
* **Foreign Key**: is a field (or a set of fields) in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It creates a relationship between two tables and enforces referential integrity.
* **DML**: are SQL commands that maintain and query a database
* **DDL**: are SQL commands that define a database, including creating, altering, and dropping tables and establishing constraints
* **Outer JOIN**: is a type of SQL join that returns matched rows from two tables along with the unmatched rows from one or both tables, filling in missing values with NULLs.

## Part 2: Hands On

```
-- ### 1. Find users from "New York", ordering results by `creationDate` and display only their id, display name, and location. Note that you should include cases such as "New York ...", "... New York", and "... New York ..."

select id, displayname, location from users
where location like "%New York%"
order by creationdate;

-- 21 row(s) returned

-- # id, displayname, location
-- 5, Kasra Rahjerdi, New York, United States
-- 6, Kevin Montrose, New York City, New York
-- 8, David Fullerton, New York, NY
-- 82, Anna Lear, New York, NY
-- 107, Jeni, New York, United States
-- 113, SamtheBrand, New York, United States
-- 118, zompz, New York, NY
-- 120, Max, New York, United States
-- 122, Laura, New York, United States
-- 123, Abby T. Miller, New York, NY

-- ### 2. We know that both questions and answers are stored in the `posts` table. We wonder how many types are there in the posts table? Order results by post type ID.

SELECT distinct PostTypeId FROM posts
ORDER BY PostTypeID;

-- 4 row(s) returned

-- # PostTypeId
-- 1
-- 2
-- 4
-- 5

-- ### 3.  Continuing with the previous query, find out the count of each Post Type, ordering results from the highest to the lowest count. The column header for count must be "count" and the column header for `PostTypeID` should be "Post Type ID".

-- > Hint: `count` is a reserved word in SQL.

SELECT PostTypeId as `Post Type ID`,
    COUNT(*) AS `count` FROM posts
GROUP BY PostTypeId
ORDER BY `count` desc;

-- 4 row(s) returned

-- # Post Type ID, count
-- 2, 1585
-- 1, 947
-- 5, 168
-- 4, 168

-- ### 4. If a question owner is satisified with one of the answers, he/she can mark the answer as an Accepted Answer (The answer's post id saved in `AcceptedAnswerID` field of the posts table). Show all the question posts on or after May 1, 2024 that DO NOT yet have an Accepted Answer, displaying the posts' id, type ID, creation date, owner user id, and title.

Select id, posttypeid, creationdate, owneruserid, title
from posts
where posttypeid=1
    and AcceptedAnswerId is null
    and creationdate >= "2024-05-01";

-- 6 row(s) returned

-- 3095, 1, 2024-05-03 17:22:37, 1302, Do miniature cows with cat like agility exist?

-- ### 5. Show all the Answer posts in January 2024, ordering results by creation date and display the answer posts' ID, post type ID, creation date, and a trucated version of the answer body (the first 50 characters) as `body`.

-- Hint: `Left(string_value, x)` returns the first x characters of the string_value

SELECT id, posttypeid, creationdate,
    left(body,50) as body FROM posts
WHERE postTypeid=2 and
    creationdate BETWEEN "2024-01-01" AND "2024-01-31"
ORDER BY CreationDate;

-- ### 6. For each Answer post with 25 or higher scores, displaying their vote count for each type of votes, along with the post's id, title, and first 50 characters of their body.

SELECT p.id, title, left(body, 50) as body,
    votetypeid, COUNT(*) AS vote_count
FROM posts AS p JOIN votes as v ON p.Id = v.PostId
WHERE score>=25 and votetypeid=2
GROUP BY p.id, title, score, votetypeid
order by score desc;

-- ##7. Find each customer's last payment date. A customer must be shown even if the customer does not have any payment. Show `customernumber`, `customername`, and last payment date (as "last_pay_date"). Order results by `customername`.

SELECT c.customernumber, customername, MAX(paymentdate) AS last_pay_date
FROM customers AS c
LEFT JOIN payments AS p ON c.customernumber = p.customernumber
GROUP BY c.customernumber
ORDER BY customername;

-- ### 8.  Write an `INSERT INTO` statement(s) to enter the following four entries into the `orderdetails` table.

-- A customer places the following two orders numbered 30 and 31 respectively.

-- |**Order Number** | **Product Code** | **quantity** | **unit price** | **Order line number** |
-- | -| -| -| -| -|
-- | 30 | S18_4600 | 20 | $79.99 | 1 |
-- | 30 | S700_1938 | 5 | $50.00 | 2 |

-- | 30 | S24_4258 | 20 | $75.00 | 4 |

Insert into orders (orderNumber, orderDate,
    requiredDate, status, customerNumber)
values (30, "2025-05-31", "2025-06-07", "In Process", 114);

-- 1 row(s) affected

INSERT INTO orderdetails
VALUES ( 30, 'S18_4600', 20, 79.99, 1 ) , ( 30, 'S700_1938', 5, 50, 2 ) ,
 ( 30, 'S700_3962', 15, 65, 3 ), ( 30, 'S24_4258', 20, 75, 4) ;

 -- 4 rows affected

-- Alternatively, one can insert into `orderdetails` line by line:

INSERT INTO orderdetails VALUES ( 30, 'S18_4600', 20, 79.99, 1 );
INSERT INTO orderdetails VALUES ( 30, 'S700_1938', 5, 50, 2 ) ;
INSERT INTO orderdetails VALUES ( 30, 'S700_3962', 15, 65, 3 );
INSERT INTO orderdetails VALUES ( 31, 'S24_4258', 20, 75, 4);

-- 4 rows affected

-- ### 9. Write an update statement to update the line 1 of order 30 to increase the price for this item by 5.

UPDATE orderdetails SET priceEach = priceEach + 5
WHERE orderNumber = 30 AND orderlinenumber = 1;
-- 1 rows affected.

-- ### 10. Delete the order line(s) for order 30 in `orderdetails` and the order 30 in orders.

DELETE from orderdetails
WHERE ordernumber=30;

-- 4 row(s) affected

DELETE from orders
WHERE ordernumber=30;

-- 1 row(s) affected
