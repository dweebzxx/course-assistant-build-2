After receiving peer feedback on your Commencement Teaching Story, you should revise the story as needed. You should film the FINAL 3 MINUTE version for Professor Vlad below -- up to 3 minutes. Note that students will be able to see each other's videos because this exercise is like sharing your story with the class.

NOTE: If you're still working on your final teaching story, proceed with the rest of Module 3.

Here is the [GUIDE: Process for Story](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/486812/files/48715951/download?wrap=1 "1.11 STORY GUIDE.docx") for your convenience.

After you finish, submit your **second** 90-second Reflection video. It should focus either on something you found most interesting or useful in the second half of the book OR on 1-2 big-picture learnings from the entire book. If you have more material than 90 seconds, cut it down to the most important things. Don't hesitate to tell us a story ;)

After receiving feedback on your Who I Am story, you should revise the story as needed. You should film the FINAL 2-MINUTE version for Professor Vlad  below. If your video is longer than 2 minutes, you need to cut it down to 2 minutes (this is a key part of the story). You should NOT read the story; pretend instead that you're telling someone this story in a conversation. Note that students will be able to see each other's videos because this exercise is like sharing your story with the class.

NOTE: If you're still working on your final Who I Am story, proceed with the rest of Module 2.

**I****NTENT:** *How* do you want them to feel and think?

**M****ESSAGE:** *What* is the takeaway?

Here is a document outlining everything said in the speech broken down into the separate AIMs to help.

By this point in the course you should have finished reading the first half of *Made to Stick*.  If you haven't finished yet, go read now!

After you finish the first half, submit your 90-second Reflection video using Kaltura in Canvas (the same as for your Grandparent Introduction video earlier). If you have more material than 90 seconds, cut it down to the most important things. As noted in the syllabus, the video is worth 5 points but is NOT graded. This video will be available for viewing by everyone in the class. It should focus on 1-2 things that you found most interesting or useful in the book.  Don't hesitate to tell us a story ;)

At this point you should have done some digging to brainstorm for your Commencement Teaching Story assignment (see Module 2.5). The next step is to choose a specific story and work on writing a draft.

Module 2.7 will guide you through our Process to make your story better. This module also includes several sample stories and Professor Vlad providing feedback on these stories.

IMPORTANT: You need to submit your written Commencement Teaching story draft by Sunday, April 13 (see Module 2.8 to submit). You will use this draft to workshop your story in your second group meeting that should be scheduled for April 14-20.

At this point in the class you should have done some digging to brainstorm for your Who I Am Story assignment (see Module 1.9 Finding Stories). The next step is to choose a specific story and work on writing a draft.

Module 11.1 will guide you through our Process to make your story better. This module also includes several sample stories and Professor Vlad providing feedback on these stories. 

IMPORTANT: You need to submit your written Who I Am story draft by Sunday, March 30 (see Module 1.12 to submit). You will use this draft to workshop your story in your first group meeting that should be scheduled for March 31-April 6.

Two Different Modes of Presenting Information

Analytical Mode: They’re trying to persuade me – *be on guard!*

Story Mode: They’re telling a story – *let’s listen!*

INSIGHT 1: Stories Lower People’s Defenses

INSIGHT 2: Stories Make People Feel

INSIGHT 3: Stories Complement Logic and Facts

After this video, you will do a longer brainstorming exercise that will involve writing. You can start with your notes from last time (Module 1.9) OR you can start fresh. There is no wrong way to dig through your memories.

Because this is a personal exercise, you don't need to submit it. Think of it as personal notes to yourself that you will use to start working on the second big assignment in the class.
