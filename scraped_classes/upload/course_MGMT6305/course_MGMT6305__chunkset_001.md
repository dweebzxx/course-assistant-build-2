## Week 7: The International Political Environment

### Sessions 13: Wednesday, March 4, 2026, 5:45-7:15pm

**SUBJECT:** The International Wartime Risk Environment

**READINGS:**

[***Navigating Wartime Communications: Multinational Corporations in the Russia-Ukraine War***](https://primo.lib.umn.edu/permalink/01UMN_INST/oqqrhb/cdi_crossref_primary_10_1556_204_2023_00024). *Society and Economy*, 46(1): 1-23.

**[Russian Language Summary of 2024 Annual Conference on "Turf Education" Run by Engo in Dubai, Apparently Co-Sponsored by Toro.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JaR_S5poso "Link")**

**CASE DISCUSSION:** [***Toro Earnings Call on Activity in Ukraine and Russia, March 2022***](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/03/03/the-toro-company-ttc-q1-2022-earnings-call-transcr/).

**Submit Answers to Discussion Questions If Last (Family) Name Starts with S-U.**

**Synopsis.** Three years ago, it would’ve seemed strange to devote a course session to how (US) firms do business in wartime. Then the world changes, we get over the shock, and business pundits tell us we should’ve seen it (and planned for it) all along. So there. This session begins with four anecdotes about four firms doing business in and with Russia and Ukraine since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Each anecdote comes with a “lesson” for other firms that may face this situation in the near term. We’ll spend more time on one particular anecdote and lesson involving the Toro Corporation and its regional distributor in Russia and the Ukraine, Engo. I want you to read through the transcript of Toro’s quarterly earnings call with analysts from March 2022, only weeks after Russia’s invasion began and Western countries aghast at Russia’s aggression imposed economic sanctions leading to business closures and exits throughout Russia. Opening comments from Toro’s CEO sought to anticipate and neutralize claims that the company was still doing business in Russia. Look closely at those comments and then the lack of any analyst follow-up questions about those comments. Then look at the Engo website and contemporary statements by Engo’s CEO Norbert Zatko (translated via Google from Russian to English). Something’s amiss. We’ll discuss that and see where it takes us about how MNEs conduct themselves with integrity in wartime.

 **Discussion Questions:**

* Why do you think Toro does business internationally via distributors? What are the advantages and disadvantages of that approach?
* Look at the Engo (Russia) website. What percentage of space and text do they devote to promoting Toro and Toro products for turf, lawncare, and golf course maintenance? Put another way, how important is Toro as a (an exclusive) supplier of products and services to Engo?
* Think about the Toro CEO’s comments about “bad” information regarding Toro’s activities in Russia. Were they false? Were they misleading? Does it matter to you whether they are one or both?
* Why do you think Toro analysts were so apparently uninterested in those comments? What does it tell you about business and finance community interests during wartime?

### Session 14: Wednesday, March 4, 2026, 7:35-9:05pm

**SUBJECT:** Populism and International Investment

**READINGS:**

James, Barclay, Lindner, Thomas, Puhr, Harald, and Vaaler, Paul. 2024. [***The Right-Wing Shift: Partisanship, Populism, and MNE Project Risk in Europe.***](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/files/57295397?wrap=1 "HJLV_Right_Shift_WP_6Dec2024.docx") Working Paper: University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.     

**GUIDED DISCUSSION:** Populism and Foreign Investment

**Submit Answers to Discussion Questions If Last (Family) Name Starts with V-Z.**

[***What Does European Populism Mean for Investment? (CHECK THIS)***](https://apg.nl/en/publication/what-does-european-populism-mean-for-investments/)

**Synopsis.** Populist politics, politicians, and parties are increasingly prominent in the industrialized democracies of Western and Central Europe. What does it mean for investment, particularly foreign-led investment? This session is dedicated to analysis and discussion of near-term populist political and investment trends. We will first review the comments of an economic expert working for a professional investment management company in the Netherlands, APG. Then, we will review findings from what may be the first broad-sample statistical study of foreign- and domestic-led infrastructure investment trends following national elections that lead to ebbs and flows of general, left-wing, and right-wing populist party political support. As you will see from both the comments and study, it is not so much populist politicians and parties that raise concerns for investors, it is *right-wing* populist politicians and parties that raise those concerns for *foreign-led* investors and their projects. We will analyze why that’s the case and what it means not only for Europe but for other parts of the world where right-wing populist parties or wings of such parties are ascendant.

 **Discussion Questions:**

* What does “populism” mean to you? Some analysts think there are “varieties” of populism. If so, then how would you describe the European variety based on the comments from the APG expert?
* In my paper with Chris Hartwell, Barclay James, and Thomas Lindner there are three theories of foreign investment and political risk: opportunistic, partisan, and (partisan) populist. How do the first two contribute to the last one?
* If you were a non-German MNE looking to invest in a Germany increasingly attracted to right-wing populist parties like the *Alternative für Deutschland* (AfD), what would you do to make that investment give it a more “domestic” look?
* Are right-wing populist parties good for investment in Europe? Are they good for the US?

## Week 8: The International Social Environment

### Session 15: Wednesday, March 18, 2026, 5:45-7:15pm

**SUBJECT:** The International Corporate Social Responsibility

**READINGS**:

Clement, Ronald W. 2005. ***The Lessons from Stakeholder Theory for US Business Leaders***. *Business Horizons*, 48: 255-264. Harvard Business School Publishing Product #BH122-PDF-ENG.

Friedman, Milton. 1970. [***A Friedman Doctrine‐- The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits.***](https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html) *New York Times* online, September 13.

Schwab, Klaus. 2008. [***Global Corporate Citizenship: Working with Governments and Civil Society***](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/global-corporate-citizenship). *Foreign Affairs* online, January/February.

**GUIDED DISCUSSION:** ***How Much to Give to Two Chinese Cities* (No Prep: Facts Presented in Class)**

This course session is dedicated to surveying and applying three perspectives on how firms generally and MNEs more specifically define and discharge social responsibilities: 1) an ethical egoist perspective defining and discharging them based on how much they serve MNE shareholder wealth maximization; 2) a stakeholder utilitarian perspective doing the same based on how much they serve a range of MNE stakeholders; and 3) a corporate citizenship deontological perspective doing the same based on MNE duties to act no matter their impact on shareholders or stakeholders. We’ll survey their histories, logics, and typical applications in MNEs today. Then we’ll apply them to a fictional scenario involving Target and two cities in China where Target sources many of the goods sold in their stores. I’ll go over the facts of this scenario involving natural catastrophes leaving thousands in need of food and homes. I will ask you to apply one of these three CSR perspectives in making recommendations to senior Target executives about how much to donate for how long. I am pretty sure you’re recommendations will differ substantially depending on which CSR perspective guides you.

 **Discussion Questions:**

* Define in brief CSR and these three CSR perspectives. Which do you think explains the CSR activities of MNEs in the Twin Cities?
* For some, Milton Friedman’s 1970 opinion piece in the *New York Times* seems like a heartless statement about CSR. For others, it is a realistic statement about the limitations of the firm as a moral entity and presumptive moral wisdom of firm executives. Where do you fall between these two positions?
* How do you think Freeman’s formulation of stakeholder theory applies to MNEs with workers domestically and multiple foreign locales? And to domestic and foreign host governments?
* Schwab describes MNEs as “citizens” with certain global duties to act for social purposes even if the economic benefit of such action is not easy to discern. Isn’t that the province of government?

### Session 16: Wednesday, March 18, 2026, 7:35-9:05pm

**SUBJECT:** The International “Bluewashing” Environment

**READING**:

Burkett, C. & Bernardo, J. 2015. [***The Rana Plaza Class Action – Is Canada the Next Frontier for Global Human Rights Litigation?***](http://www.labourandemploymentlaw.com/2015/11/the-rana-plaza-class-action-is-canada-the-next-frontier-for-global-human-rights-litigation/)*Canadian Labor and Employment Law*, November 23.

*Minnesota Star Tribune*. 2013. [***Business: Target Weighs Options after Deadly Factory Collapse, Fire in Bangladesh.***](https://www.startribune.com/target-weighs-options-after-deadly-factory-collapse-fire-in-bangladesh/206049081) *Minnesota Star and Tribune* online. May 4.

Target. 2014. [***Target Talks Progress on Bangladesh Worker Safety***](https://corporate.target.com/news-features/article/2014/04/target-talks-progress-on-bangladesh-worker-safety)***.*** Target Stores: Minneapolis, MN, April 22.

**Case Discussion:** [***The Rana Plaza Disaster***](https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/video/collapse-at-rana-plaza)

**Synopsis.** “Bluewashing” refers to actions taken by firms that appear to serve some social purpose, but are actually meant to serve the firm’s self-interest, usually firm profitability.  This course session is devoted to understanding whether and how that term applies to the actions of Target and other foreign retailers buying from the Bangladesh-based Rana Plaza clothing manufacturing facility while also supposedly assuring the facility’s adherence to high-quality worker safety standards. The 2013 collapse of the facility in 2013 killed hundreds and led to criticism of foreign retailers, including Target for touting statements to stakeholders about their socially responsible approach as a form of advertising. It even led to a lawsuit for damages in Canada against another Canadian retailer, Loblaws. The aim of this course session is to understand when and how MNEs assume this safety oversight role and when it whipsaws on them legally or otherwise. 

 **Discussion Questions:**

* What intrinsic duties do MNEs owe foreign workers and communities when they engage them as suppliers?
* How far can an MNE go before it assumes some duty to those workers and communities no matter where you stand on intrinsic duties? Why would any MNE exceed the intrinsic minimum?
* Would you permit the Rana Plaza case to be heard in Canadian rather than in Bangladeshi courts?
* After Rana Plaza, how would you advise Target on supervision of safety in other foreign supplier?

## Week 2: IEB Foundations

### Session 3: Wednesday, January 28, 2026, 5:45-7:15pm

**SUBJECT**:      Where and How Quickly Do Firms Internationalize?

**READINGS**:

Vernon, R. 1966.  [International investment and international trade in the product cycle](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/files/57295418?wrap=1).  *Quarterly Journal of Economics*, Volume 80:  190-207.

Ibarra, H.  1996.  National cultures and work-related values:  The Hofstede study.  HBSP #9-496-044.

**CASE DISCUSSION:** The Espresso Lane to Global Markets, W12038-PDF-ENG

**Synopsis:** Founded in Trieste, Italy, Illy marketed a unique blend of coffee drinks in over 140 countries and in more than 50,000 of the world's best restaurants and coffeehouses. The company wanted to expand the reach of its own franchised coffee bar, *Espressamente*, through international expansion. Potential markets included Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, India, the United Kingdom and the United States. In addition to market selection, mode of entry was vital and included options such as exporting, franchising and joint venture. This case provides a practical example of the challenges faced in international business.  It also gives us an opportunity to understand alternative internationalization paths.  Do MNEs and SMEs follow economic or sociological considerations when taking that path?  Do they care more about a foreign country’s market size or cultural similarity?

 **Discussion Questions:**

* Is espresso coffee retailing a global industry? What do you think is the most important factor behind Illy’s efforts to internationalize operations.?
* And what about the pattern of internationalization? How does the path of foreign market entry and development confirm, disconfirm or perhaps render irrelevant Hofstede’s ideas about cultural distance and business practices across certain country groups?
* Maybe Illy’s luck is running out. The last big national market for its product, the US is approaching maturity in the industry product life cycle is reaching maturity in other countries worth entering.  Defend or attack this assessment.  No fence-sitting allowed.

### Session 4: Wednesday, January 28, 2026, 7:35-9:05pm

**SUBJECT:** How Do Firms Organize to Internationalize?

**READINGS:**

Bartlett, C. & Ghoshal, S. 2003. What is a global manager?  *Harvard Business Review* Article, HBSP # R0308F.

Perlmutter, H. 1969. ‘[The tortuous evolution of the multinational corporation](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/files/57295372?wrap=1 "Perlmutter_CJWB_1969.pdf")’, *Columbia Journal of World Business*, Volume 4:  9-18.

**CASE DISCUSSION:** Philips vs. Matsushita:  The Competitive Battle Continues. HBSP #9-10-410

**Synopsis:**  This case contrasts the development of Philips' and Matsushita's international organizations and associated organizational capabilities. Philips, with fully developed national organizations abroad, struggles to coordinate its operations on a global scale, but encounters strong resistance to organizational and cultural changes. Grim financial results in early 1990s cast doubt on the company's previous 20 years of organizational and strategic change. Matsushita, the highly centralized industry leader, struggles to internationalize its organization by decentralizing assets, responsibilities, and decision making. Its attempts to build independent national organizations abroad are equally disappointing.  This case gives us an opportunity to raise issues relating internal strategy processes and structures to external global strategy content.  In short, how does MNE internal process and structure influence external conflict between the MNE and other firms?

 **Discussion Questions:**

* How did Philips become the leading consumer electronics company in the world in the postwar era? What distinctive resources/abilities/competencies did Philips build?  What distinctive disadvantages?
* How did Matsushita succeed in displacing Philips as No. 1? What were its distinctive resources/abilities/competencies?  And its distinctive disadvantages?
* What do you think of the change each MNE has made to date -objectives, implementation, impact? Why is the change so hard for both of them?
* What recommendations would you make to the Philips CEO? To the Matushita CEO?

**SUBJECT:** The International Political Risk Environment I

**READINGS:**

Vaaler, P. 2015.  [Note on International Credit Rating Agencies and Sovereign Risk Ratings.](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/files/57295394?wrap=1 "Vaaler_Rating_Agency_Note_2015-1.doc") University of Minnesota:  Minneapolis, MN.

MIGA. 2024. [***What We Do: Products (information on political risk insurance types and coverage)***](https://www.miga.org/products). (Review the types of PRI offered and key terms in glossary documents for each PRI type.)

**CASE DISCUSSION**: ***The Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project (A)*** HBSP #202010, 202012, 206139 and 207087.

**Submit Answers to Discussion Questions If Last (Family) Name Starts with M-O.**

**Synopsis:** On June 6, 2000, the World Bank's and IFC's board of directors was scheduled to vote on whether to approve funding for the $4 billion Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline project. Although the project presented a unique opportunity to alleviate poverty in Chad, one of the poorest countries in the world, Chad had a president who had been labeled "warlord" and a history of civil war and oppression. This case describes the project, the setting, and the World Bank's reasons for participating in the deal--mainly an opportunity to alleviate poverty, enforce environmental standards, and minimize the impact on indigenous people. It also describes the very public and very ardent opposition to the project's environmental, social, and revenue management policies. Faced with a high-risk, but potentially high-return opportunity to improve conditions in Chad, students, we’ll discuss decide whether it is wise to approve funding for the deal.  This case illustrates not only the complexity of negotiating very large deals between public and private entities, but also the opportunity inherent in large-scale investment. We’ll assess whether the benefits received by the host countries are commensurate with the risks they bear. This discussion raises critical ethical issues related to investment in developing countries. With regard to project finance, the case illustrates the difference between project and corporate finance and shows that risk sharing and risk mitigation are motivations for using project finance.

 **Discussion Questions:**

* What is political risk? How is it related to sovereign risk? (Session 11)
* If you were going to buy political risk insurance in the late 1990s as terms of the Chad-Cameroon pipeline project are being negotiated, then what kind of coverage when (and how much) would you buy? (Session 11)
* How do you justify the World Bank’s inclusion of Chad and Cameroon as partial equity owners in the two pipeline companies? Didn’t Ronald Reagan tell us that the nine most terrifying words in the English language are that “I’m from the government and I’m here to help.”? (Session 11)

**SUBJECT:** The International Political Risk Environment II

**Submit Answers to Discussion Questions If Last (Family) Name Starts with P-R.**

**\*Same Synopsis with Session 11**

**Synopsis:** On June 6, 2000, the World Bank's and IFC's board of directors was scheduled to vote on whether to approve funding for the $4 billion Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline project. Although the project presented a unique opportunity to alleviate poverty in Chad, one of the poorest countries in the world, Chad had a president who had been labeled "warlord" and a history of civil war and oppression. This case describes the project, the setting, and the World Bank's reasons for participating in the deal--mainly an opportunity to alleviate poverty, enforce environmental standards, and minimize the impact on indigenous people. It also describes the very public and very ardent opposition to the project's environmental, social, and revenue management policies. Faced with a high-risk, but potentially high-return opportunity to improve conditions in Chad, students, we’ll discuss decide whether it is wise to approve funding for the deal.  This case illustrates not only the complexity of negotiating very large deals between public and private entities, but also the opportunity inherent in large-scale investment. We’ll assess whether the benefits received by the host countries are commensurate with the risks they bear. This discussion raises critical ethical issues related to investment in developing countries. With regard to project finance, the case illustrates the difference between project and corporate finance and shows that risk sharing and risk mitigation are motivations for using project finance.

**Discussion Questions:**

* What is project finance-based investment and why do you think it is used in the Chad Cameroon pipeline project? (Session 12)
* Which part of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in the 1990s when the Chad Cameroon pipeline investment terms were first negotiated proved most helpful when those terms were being re-negotiated in the 20002? (Session 12)
* After all of the risk-management innovations included in this project, it still ended up having all sorts of snafus. What does that teach you about managing political risks in less developed countries? Is it nothing more than re-arranging deck chairs on the Titanic? (Session 12)

## Week 4: The International Legal Environment

### Session 7: Wednesday, February 11, 2026, 5:45-7:15pm

**SUBJECT:** The International Contracting Environment

**READING:**

Read relevant sections of [**Uniform Commercial Code, Article 2 (Sales)**](https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2) referenced in *Brands*.

Read relevant sections of the [**United Nations Convention on Contracts**](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/files/58744036?wrap=1 "UNCCISG.pdf") for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).

**CASE DISCUSSION**: [***Brands International Corporation v. Reach Companies, LLC***](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca8/23-2164/23-2164-2024-05-30.html), No. 23-2164, US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (2024).

**Submit Answers to Discussion Questions If Last (Family) Name Starts with A-C.**

**Synopsis**:  We begin module 2 with an introduction to legal issues associated with a cross-border sales transactions. The *Brands* case provides us with an opportunity to see how such transactions are negotiated between merchants, and how state and national versus international legal regimes regarding sales contracts and their interpretation differ. Among other points, *Brands* highlights the importance of carefully writing draft agreements, especially when those drafts address choice of law for their interpretation when breached. In this case, a contract for delivery of hand sanitizer on behalf of Canada-based Brands by Minnesota-based Reach failed to expressly exclude application of a separate international legal regime summarized under the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). So the CISG rather than Minnesota law governed the contract. The big issue for the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit was about whether Brands could collect attorneys’ fees from Reach for Reach’s breach of contract. The Eighth Circuit’s 2024 opinion about whether Brands could recover those fees under the CISG reversed a 2023 decision by the lower US District Court for the District of Minnesota. At first glance, the 2024 decision seemed surprising. We’ll show why it wasn’t and what it means going forward for small, medium, and large MNEs doing business around the world.

 **Discussion Questions:**

* Why does the CISG apply to the transaction in dispute between Brands and Reach (and how do you know)?
* Assuming that Minnesota law governed the contract, do you think Brands would still have been able to recover attorneys’ fees from Reach?
* What sources of law did the Eighth Circuit refer to in reversing the lower court and awarding Brands attorneys fees?
* It’s pretty clear that the attorneys for both Brands and Reach –both large MNEs— didn’t understand how choice of law rules worked in an international transaction. What does that tell you about how law matters in international transaction negotiation and dispute resolution?

### Session 8: Wednesday, February 11, 2026, 7:35-9:05pm

**SUBJECT:** The International Private Arbitration Environment

**READING:**

American Arbitration Association. 2013. [***Drafting Dispute Resolution Clauses:  A Practical Guide***](https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/document_repository/Drafting%20Dispute%20Resolution%20Clauses%20A%20Practical%20Guide.pdf). American Arbitration Association: Minneapolis, MN.

**CASE DISCUSSION**: [***Mitsubishi v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth***](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/473/614/), 473 U.S. 614 (1985).

**Submit Answers to Discussion Questions If Last (Family) Name Starts with D-F.**

**Synopsis**:  Litigation of cross-border sales and other transactions increasingly takes place in front of arbitral panels in boardrooms rather than judges and juries in courtrooms.  In this session we ask why.  Mitsubishi gives us a US perspective on this question.  And the AAA reading tells us how best to write agreements consistent with that US perspective.

 **Discussion Questions:**

* What is the function of a dispute resolution clause?
* What is arbitration compared to other non-judicial forms of dispute resolution?
* Why do parties so often use arbitration in international transactions?
* Mitsubishi seems to stand for the proposition that parties can contract away virtually all substantive rights to sue in US courts, including federal statutory rights. Is that an accurate reading of Mitsubishi?

## Week 3: IEB Foundations

### **Session 5: Wednesday, February 4, 2026, 5:45-7:15pm**

**SUBJECT:** How Do Firms and States Internationalize in Global Industries?

**READING:**

Porter, M. 1990.  The competitive advantage of nations.  *Harvard Business Review* Article, HBSP #90211

[Krugman, P., Obstfeld, M., & Melitz, M. 2012.  Chapter 12:  Controversies in trade policy. *International Economics: Theory and Policy (12th ed.)*, Addison-Wesley (Pearson), Boston, MA:  271-292](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/files/57295452?wrap=1 "Krugman_et_al_2012.pdf").

**CASE DISCUSSION:** Airbus vs. Boeing (A), HBSP #9-707-747

Airbus vs. Boeing (B):  Should Airbus Build the VLCT Alone?, HBSP #9-707-448

            Airbus vs. Boeing (F):  2002-2006, HBSP # 9-707-452

            Airbus vs. Boeing (L):  Discontinuing the A380 (February 2019), HBSP #9-720-387

**Synopsis:**  Some industries –but only some- are inherently global in nature. They are given to one, two or only a few MNEs dominating the market.  Long-haul civil aircraft manufacturing may be one those industries.  If so, then it’s a “winner-take-all” or “winner-take-most” fight by the two MNEs seeking that domination: US-based Boeing and Europe-based Airbus.  Both have benefited from government support. Airbus was created as an entity owned by several European states. Boeing was always a privately-owned entity but received substantial US government revenue as a prime defense contractor.  Both MNEs think that support (and more) justified as they mull over whether and how to develop a new generation of superjumbo jet offerings for the travelling public.  Isn’t it “good” public policy for home-country governments to subsidize their national champion MNEs if that subsidy could help their MNE win the global market and shower the home country with all sorts of positive externalities:  more employment, technology, wealth, military power, independence and influence.  That’s the setting for our case where Boeing and Airbus (and their respective home-country governments) are mulling over whether to cooperate or compete in the production of superjumbo jets in the 1990s and 2000s, and then live with that decision in the 2010s. 

 **Discussion Questions:**

* What are the characteristics of a global industry?
* Are there differences that matter between the subsidies that Airbus and Boeing receive? How do their respective home-country governments justify those subsidies?
* What is “industrial policy” according to Krugman, Obstfeld and Melitz? How does their view of industrial policy differ with Michael Porter’s explanation of government’s role in fostering firm competitive advantages?
* What is “strategic trade policy” and how does it matter in the Brander-Spence model of trade?
* How do you explain the different decisions about whether to produce superjumbo jets at Airbus and Boeing?

## Week 10: Simulating the International Environment

### Sessions 19: Wednesday, April 1, 2026, 5:45-7:15pm

**SUBJECT:** Delegation and International Trade

**READINGS:** To Be Determined

**GUIDED DISCUSSION:** Trump Tariffs and International Business Strategy

**Synopsis**: As I write up this syllabus in early January 2026, it is only a few days before the US Supreme Court is likely to render an opinion on the legality of President Trump’s tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). No matter the opinion, this case highlights new challenges facing foreign businesses trying to export to the US and domestic businesses trying to buy those goods and services. Tariffs like those imposed under the IEEPA raise costs for both firms. This guided discussion is intended to give you a better grounding for how we got to this point and what foreign exporting and US importing firms are doing to mitigate the negative business effects.

**Discussion Questions:**

* What is the origin of the IEEPA? How does it relate to other laws giving the executive branch of the US government so much power to regulate international trade, a power explicitly delegated to the legislative branch under the US Constitution?
* Explain the reasoning of the US Supreme Court decision on the legality of President Trump’s tariff impositions under the IEEPA.
* How would you advise a large European MNE exporting to the US on how to mitigate the negative effects of US tariffs?
* How would you do the same for a small US business importing those goods from Europe?

## Week 9: The International Social Environment

### Session 17: Wednesday, March 25, 2026, 5:45-7:15pm

**SUBJECT:** Migrant Remittances and International Entrepreneurship

**READINGS:**

Vaaler, P. 2015.  [Cabbies and capital:  Migrants are re-shaping the developing world](https://eiexchange.com/content/79-cabbies-and-capital-migrants-are-re-shaping-the).  Entrepreneur and Innovation Exchange (EIX).  Schulze School of Entrepreneurship, University of St. Thomas:  Minneapolis, MN.

**CASE DISCUSSION:** [***The Supply Side: WalMex, India’s PhonePe Grow Ecosystems Inside Walmart International***](https://talkbusiness.net/2024/07/the-supply-side-walmex-indias-phonepe-grow-ecosystems-inside-walmart-international).

**Synopsis**. The fifth largest country in the world is the virtual country of Diasporia.  There are about 300,000,000 people living in countries where they were not born or raised. The bulk are migrants from countries of the Developing South (*e.g*., Philippines) living and working in countries of the Developed North (*e.g*., US). And those migrants are remitting to their home countries more than $650 billion annually.  Migrant remittances are now the largest foreign capital inflow into most developing countries.  What are the remittances used for? The lion’s share of a remitted dollar (or Euro or Yen) goes to finance household consumption of necessities like food and clothing and healthcare. But a substantial percentage also goes to funding, founding, and growing micro businesses in those same households. So migrants, remittances, and venture investment in developing countries are now an increasingly important part of the social environment of businesses large and small.  In this session we’ll learn how and why.  We’ll also learn how you can exploit business-related opportunities. The WalMex and PhonePe initiatives are two examples of intermediaries looking to exploit business opportunities related to remittances. We will evaluate these and then give you the opportunity to dream up your own “value-added” business idea. Maybe you’ll be the next MNE to win big from remittances.

**Discussion Questions:**

* What is a migrant? What are remittances?  Why have both grown so quickly since 2000?
* How does economic “informality” change remittance use in a household in a developing country?
* The WalMex and PhonePe initiatives are two attempts to build profitable ecosystems around migrants and their remittances. How do you evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each?
* What’s your value-added remittance idea? It doesn’t require you to be a big MNE like WalMart, just someone able to match a remitting migrant’s interest in the host country to a migrant recipient’s need in the home country. Let’s call it “transnational knowledge.”

### Session 18: Wednesday, March 25, 2026, 7:35-9:05pm

**SUBJECT:** Discrimination and International Marketing

**READINGS:**

Economist. 2017. [Uncharted Territory: Why Some Airlines Remove Israel from their Online Route Maps](http://https/www.economist.com/gulliver/2017/03/08/why-some-airlines-remove-israel-from-their-online-route-maps). March 8.

Note on the Global Airline Industry 2020. #W21009-PDF-ENG.

**GUIDED DISCUSSION:** Delta Airlines and Their Middle Eastern SkyTeam Allies.

**Synopsis:** Alliances have been central features of US, European, and other international airline strategies since the 2010s. Reasons for their emergence are varied, but two major reasons stand out: national state regulation of air space and landing rights; and national state ownership of airlines. The first major reason lets national governments favor domestic airlines and airline business objectives. The second lets national governments control domestic airlines and government political objectives. Sometimes the two overlap as in the case of two Delta SkyTeam alliance members, Saudia and MEA (Lebanon). It may seem irrelevant, but both single out Israel for omission as a country on their airline route maps. We’ll analyze why they and a select group of other state-owned airlines from the Middle East “deny” Israel’s existence on their route maps: Is it to support home-country political objectives, airline business (profitability) objectives, or both? Get ready to learn more about “discriminatory product differentiation” among airlines Delta embraces as allies.

**Discussion Questions**:

* How would you describe the structure of the international airline industry in the mid-2010s?
* Which alliance is best positioned for success in the 2020s?
* The 2017 *Economist* article suggests that some international airlines in the 2010s compete by subtly discriminating against Israelis and Jews. But many of these same airlines are also in alliances led by US airlines touting their record of non-discrimination. Which alliance is best positioned to avoid such intra-alliance conflicts in the 2020s?

**Synopsis**:  This case kicks off Module 1 and our study of foundational IEB concepts and issues.  Perhaps *the* foundational issue is why firms go abroad as an MNC or SME.  Why not stay at home and trade goods and services with foreign firms in international markets?  And if the firm is so “bold” as to go abroad as an MNC or SME, then how does it go abroad, that is, with what form of foreign direct investment (FDI). Lincoln Electric is a Cleveland-based welding services firm that has already gone abroad as an MNC but is now considering India as  new international market.  Lincoln’s CEO is mulling over whether to invest in India, and if so, with what form of FDI.  You will help him with that decision.  First, we’ll ground it in a broader theoretical framework explaining when it makes sense for firms to go abroad as an MNC or SME.  It is the ownership-location-internalization (OLI) framework.  The OLI framework might also help in addressing the second question about how to enter.

**Discussion Questions:**

* Should Lincoln Electric enter India?
* If so, should Lincoln Electric own a manufacturing operation there? If so, then should the company acquire a local player or build their own greenfield plant?
* If a joint venture is preferred, then think about how Lincoln Electric will ensure its ability to make key business decisions in India.
* John Dunning analyzes the decision to internationalize a firm’s operations as a function of that firm’s ownership, location and internalization (OLI) factors. How do you apply the OLI factors to Lincoln Electric and its decision about whether to enter India.

## Week 5: International Legal Environment

### Session 9: Wednesday, February 18, 2026, 5:45-7:15pm

**SUBJECT:** The International Investor-State Dispute Settlement Environment

**READINGS:**

McMillan. 2022. [***McMillan LLP’s CUSMA Dispute Settlement Scoreboard***](https://mcmillan.ca/insights/mcmillan-llps-cusma-dispute-settlement-scoreboard/). McMillan LLP Law Firm, Toronto, Canada, March 11.

**CASE DISCUSSION:** [***Finley Resources and Others v. Mexico***](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/decision/en-finley-resources-inc-mws-management-inc-and-prize-permanent-holdings-llc-v-united-mexican-states-decision-on-jurisdiction-and-liability-monday-4th-november-2024), ICSID Case No. ARB/21/25 (2024).

**Submit Answers to Discussion Questions If Last (Family) Name Starts with G-I.**

**Synopsis**. How do MNEs sue a sovereign state? Up until the early 1960s the question was irrelevant. MNEs couldn’t. Then countries started signing international investment agreements (IIAs) including investor state dispute resolution terms permitting such suits under certain conditions. The *Finley* case helps us understand how such suits can go forward under two of the most important IIAs: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) enacted in the early 1990s under the Clinton administration; and the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) enacted in the late 2010s under the (first) Trump administration. The *Finley* cases applies both IIAs, so we can get a sense of how both differ in the rights and obligations they impose on MNEs trying to hold states to account. The Finley case is long. First, browse through it just to get a sense of how long and winding a road it is for MNEs like Finley to exploit IIAs, particularly the newer USMCA. Then try to acquaint yourselves with the facts of the alleged breach of contract by Mexico’s state-owned subsidiary of Pemex, PEP.  Finally, look at the conclusion of the decision by the ICSID tribunal ultimately awarding damages –money— to Finley. Was it all worth it for Finley?

**Discussion Questions:**

* Which dispute resolution mechanisms were more effective for Finley in its dispute with the Mexican government?
* How do NAFTA-based dispute resolution terms differ with USMCA-based terms?
* Look at the McMillans LLP publication analyzing different ways to sue states under the USMCA. A direct lawsuit by an MNE against a state isn’t the only way to try and hold a state accountable. What’s wrong with using those alternatives?
* If, after studying the *Finley* case, you were advising other small- or medium-sized MNEs about how IIAs “protect” themselves in transactions with foreign states, what advice would you emphasize?

### Session 10: Wednesday, February 18, 2026, 7:35-9:05pm

**SUBJECT:** The International Bribery and Corruption Environment

**READINGS:**

SEC. 2023 [***Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)***](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement/foreign-corrupt-practices-act).US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): Washington, DC.

SEC. 2023. [***SEC Charges 3M with Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Violations Relating to China Subsidiary***](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023-160). US Securities and Exchange Commission: Washington, DC. August 25.

**CASE DISCUSSION**: [***3M China Bribery Case.***](https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2023/08/25/3m-will-pay-65-million-over-allegedly-funding-tourism-for-chinese-officials/)

**Submit Answers to Discussion Questions If Last (Family) Name Starts with J-L.**

**Synopsis**. Issues of bribery and corruption often confront MNEs, particularly when dealing with host-country government officials, and particularly in developing countries. The US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is a US response to that issue with its origins in two notorious instances of bribery involving the sale of military planes to Japan and civil aircraft to Pakistan. Since then, the FCPA has undergone several revisions and other wealthier industrialized countries in Western Europe and the Pacific have enacted similar laws. The 2023 3M China bribery case is important to understand not just to see how the FCPA works in practice but to understand how easy it is to detect by MNE headquarters and then respond to effectively. It is pretty clear that 3M’s healthcare subsidiary operations in China were bribing Chinese health ministry officials for years before 3M’s headquarters in suburban St. Paul discovered it. After this case was settled, 3M “spun off” its healthcare division into a separate MNE. Reviewing this case in light of the subsequent spin off will help us understand how MNE organization and oversight capability matter for the control of bribery abroad.

 **Discussion Questions:**

* Look at the summary description of the FCPA and the summary of 3M’s FCPA violation in two documents published online by the SEC. What were the elements of 3M’s FCPA violation?
* At first glance, the fines and disgorgement 3M paid out to settle the FCPA violations seemed to be pretty small compared to the business advantages 3M likely gained over the years it bribed Chinese health officials with luxury trips to “educational” conferences. What other costs do you think 3M’s FCPA violations prompted?
* In 2023, 3M’s healthcare division was one of many in a highly diversified MNE. The spin-off of the healthcare division into a separate company in 2024 meant that the new MNE would serve only one industry. How does that matter for future oversight of operations for future FCPA violations?
