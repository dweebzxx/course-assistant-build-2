I am happy to answer questions and discuss any issues or ideas you may have. To enable this, I will try to be available as much as possible during our synchronous class sessions and at the end of each day to briefly discuss anything that would be helpful for your career and leadership development. If you would like to have a lengthier chat or focused discussion, let’s set up a time. Please book time with me directly via Calendly by scheduling a slot that works for you (we’ll both automatically receive a calendar invite with a Zoom link): [https://calendly.com/campbele/30minLinks to an external site.](https://calendly.com/campbele/30min). If the slots available for students do not work for you, please email me with several proposed alternatives (including Saturday or Sunday, if need be).
