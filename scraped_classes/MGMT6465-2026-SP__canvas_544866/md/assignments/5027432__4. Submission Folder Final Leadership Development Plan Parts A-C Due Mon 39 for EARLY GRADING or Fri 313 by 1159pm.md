**Final Leadership Development Plan**

Other assignments in the course pave the way for this, our big-ticket deliverable. The purpose of your Final Leadership Development paper is to chart a longer-term vision and short-term roadmap for your personal development. This should be the most valuable assignment for you and represent something that serves you long after the course ends. It takes the form of one paper comprised of three parts. Below are several strong exemplar papers. So that you can clearly understand how to structure your paper and how it will be evaluated, I have written a detailed overview, which also contains the grading rubric: [Final Leadership Development Plan.pdf](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/544866/files/57964863?verifier=f4zBmXniokoomJ9p7lysoD4UyqhMjX0gD5htzV50&wrap=1 "Final Leadership Development Plan.pdf")

Please upload your Final Leadership Development Paper as one document. Part C (leadership legacy slides) can be included in that document or uploaded separately (i.e., as PDF or PPT). I have enabled you to upload two documents.

*Note: In prior terms, there was a Time-Use Assessment and a corresponding write-up/analysis. Due to the compressed nature of the term and to reduce students' pre-work responsibilities given all that has been going on, this part of the assignment has been omitted this term.*

Deadline Options:

From years of teaching this course, I have learned that students tend to segment into two groups: those who prefer to submit early and get their grade more swiftly (e.g., for potential employer course reimbursement), and those who favor a later date since they are particularly busy this month (i.e., with other courses and commitments, travel, etc.). Consequently, I have two due dates for your Final Leadership Development Plan, which you can elect based on preference.

Early Submission Deadline: Monday, 3/9 (by 11:59pm)

Extended Submission Deadline: Fri, 3/13 (by 11:59pm)
