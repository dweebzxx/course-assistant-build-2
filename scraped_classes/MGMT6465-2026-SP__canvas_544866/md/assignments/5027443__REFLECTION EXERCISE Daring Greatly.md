**REFLECTION EXERCISE, Challenge the Process--Daring Greatly**

*(Recall that you can do this OR the other Challenge the Process reflection; pick which best serves your development)*

* *Take a few minutes to reflect, then answer each question below.**You may reference and resubmit content after initial submission.*
* *As with all of our course's reflection exercises, taking time to think and organize your thoughts is what is most valuable. These are all designed as notes for your development, not my own reading/grading. The more thoughtful your reflection and answers, the more likely it is that these thought exercises will help you plan and write your final Leadership Development Plan.*

*You should share and capture in prose (or bullet points) what best serves you. Prompts are to encourage growth without pushing you to share more than you want.  Using GenAI on prompts would be an "interesting choice"—if an individual were outsourcing their introspection and leadership development to a robot, would you hire them? GPT might hire them, but you shouldn't.*

**1. Identify a daring failure**. Think of a time you put yourself out there, and it didn’t work (work or personal). Briefly capture: (a) What you attempted and why it mattered; b) What the outcome was; c) How you responded in the moment (what you did/said next), and d) One lesson you’d want your future self to remember (and one behavior you’d repeat or change next time)

**2. Audit your perceived constraints.** (“We can’t because…”). List the likely “We can’t do this because…” statements that could constrain your project/work (e.g., time, staffing, politics, risk, priorities, stakeholders, capabilities). Write 5-7 statements as they would realistically be said out loud.

**3. Reality check (+ / –)**. Now, go back through your list and mark each statement:

* (+) actually true/hard constraint (at least for now)
* (–) not fully true, uncertain, or challengeable  
  *(If helpful: add (?) for “I don’t know yet”)*

**4. Challenge your assumptions and surface potential solutions.** Choose 2–3 “–” statements to challenge (turn constraints into experiments). For the 2–3 most important challengeable constraints, write:

* The statement: “We can’t because \_\_\_.”
* The hidden assumption underneath it: “This assumes \_\_\_.”
* A better question to replace it: “How might we \_\_\_ despite \_\_\_?”
* One small experiment you could run to test it (a conversation, pilot, prototype, data check, stakeholder ask)

**5. Commit (next ~14 days).** Choose one experiment from above that you will actually run in the next two weeks. Specify: a) What you’ll do + when; b) Who you’ll involve (or who you’ll ask); c) The 1–2 questions you’ll ask; and d) How you’ll capture what you learn (3 bullets, notes, voice memo).
