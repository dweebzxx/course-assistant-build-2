**REFLECTION EXERCISE: Model the Way – Part 1 (Clarifying Your Values through Evidence)**

* *Take a few minutes to reflect, then answer each question below.* *You may reference and resubmit content after initial submission.*
* *As with all of our course's reflection exercises, taking time to think and organize your thoughts is what is most valuable. These are all designed as notes for your development, not my own reading/grading. The more thoughtful your reflection and answers, the more likely it is that these thought exercises will help you plan and write your final Leadership Development Plan.*
* *You should share and capture in prose (or bullet points) what best serves you. Prompts are to encourage growth without pushing you to share more than you want.  Using GenAI on prompts would be an "interesting choice"—if an individual were outsourcing their introspection and leadership development to a robot, would you hire them? GPT might hire them, but you shouldn't.*

**1) Recall a peak experience.** Think back to one or two projects/experiences you found meaningful, rewarding, or pride-inducing (regardless of your role). For **one** experience, capture:

* **Context**: What was it? When/where? Who was involved?
* **Your role:** What did you contribute? How did you contribute?
* **Peak moment**: When did you feel most proud/energized?
* **Evidence**: What specifically happened that made it meaningful?

**2) Surface value signals (**i.e., what mattered underneath). List 3–5 signals from that experience that point to what you valued---what made it good. *For example, you might deduce that you really enjoy collaborating with others, that you like careful attention to detail, that you like creating and innovating, that you need to feel a sense of autonomy, that you value feeling empowered, trusted, or in control, that you love when groups work efficiently without drama, etc.*

***NOTE: The Part 2 Value Sort and reflection exercise referenced in the video will take place during our live session together.***
