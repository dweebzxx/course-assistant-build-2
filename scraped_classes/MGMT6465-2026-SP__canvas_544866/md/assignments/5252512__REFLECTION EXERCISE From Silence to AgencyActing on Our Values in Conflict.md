**REFLECTION EXERCISE: From Silence to Agency—Acting on Our Values in Conflict**

* *Take a few minutes to first reflect and then answer each of the questions below.* *You may reference and resubmit content after initial submission.*
* *As with all of our course's reflection exercises, taking time to think and organize your thoughts is what is most valuable. These are all designed as notes for your development, not my own reading/grading. The more thoughtful your reflection and answers, the more likely it is that these thought exercises will help you plan and write your final Leadership Development Plan.*
* *You should share and capture in prose (or bullet points) what best serves you. Prompts are to encourage growth without pushing you to share more than you want.*

**1. Recognizing tension to navigate conflict.** Where have you felt the tension Dr. Sah describes (i.e., when your instinct to comply or be conflict-avoidant collided with a deeper value)? Briefly describe the situation (work/school/home), who was involved, and what you did in the moment (e.g., stayed silent, went along, softened your message, changed the subject, spoke up boldly).

**2. Surfacing our values.** What value(s) were being activated for you in that moment? What specifically about the situation felt misaligned with that value?

**3. Agency in conflict.** Identify one person, relationship, or recurring context where you most often feel this tension. What is one small, values-aligned action you could prepare yourself to take (e.g., a question you could ask or a sentence you could say) that challenges the moment without escalating the conflict?
