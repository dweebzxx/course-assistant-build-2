<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #2b7abc;"><strong>REFLECTION EXERCISE: Leveling Up Our Growth &amp; Self-Awareness with Vulnerability</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><em><span>Take a few minutes to first reflect and then answer each of the questions below. </span></em><em>You may reference and resubmit content after initial submission. </em></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><em>As with all of our course's reflection exercises, taking time to think and organize your thoughts is what is most valuable. These are all designed as notes for your development, not my own reading/grading. The more thoughtful your reflection and answers, the more likely it is that these thought exercises will help you plan and write your final Leadership Development Plan.</em></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><em>You should share and capture in prose (or bullet points) what best serves you. Prompts are to encourage growth without pushing you to share more than you want.&nbsp;</em><em></em></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">1. <strong>Leadership development &amp; vulnerability. </strong>What idea from Dr. Brown's classic TEDx talk hit you the most, and why might it matter for leadership development specifically? Name one leadership behavior that becomes harder when projecting invulnerability?</p>
<p class="p1">2. <strong>Feigning invulnerability. </strong>Where do you tend to armor up professionally (e.g., perfectionism, staying vague, people-pleasing, always being ‘fine’)? What does that armor protect you from? What does it cost you (opportunities, relationships, learning speed, energy)? How has that impacted your professional opportunities, career path, and/or day-to-day work?</p>
<p>3. <strong>Vulnerability boundaries. </strong>What seems like “appropriate vulnerability” for you in a professional setting? What is not appropriate for you—and why? How do you decide what to share and with whom? What would “10% more brave” look like without oversharing?</p>
