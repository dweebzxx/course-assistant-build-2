<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #9242b4;"><strong>REFLECTION EXERCISE, Big Picture Legacy</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span><em>Take a few minutes to reflect, then answer each question below.&nbsp;</em><em>You may reference and resubmit content after initial submission.</em></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span><em>As with all of our course's reflection exercises, taking time to think and organize your thoughts is what is most valuable. These are all designed as notes for your development, not my own reading/grading. The more thoughtful your reflection and answers, the more likely it is that these thought exercises will help you plan and write your final Leadership Development Plan.</em></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span><em>You should share and capture in prose (or bullet points) what best serves you. Prompts are to encourage growth without pushing you to share more than you want.</em></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Good news! I’m not going to make you write your obituary! (Though it is another well-worn leadership development tool that prompts people to consider how they want to inspire). However, I do want you to think about <strong><em>the last chapter of your life</em></strong>. Picture your <strong><em>retirement party</em></strong>. I want you to think about the person who is<strong><em> giving the speech </em></strong>about your<strong><em> career, </em></strong>your<strong><em> impact, </em></strong>your<strong><em> leadership legacy</em></strong>. What do you hope they say? What do you want to be known for? What do you want your leadership legacy to be?</p>
<p>Write whatever comes to mind, even if it feels like stream-of-consciousness. Use words, phrases, bullets, or sentences. Don’t overthink this exercise. Just listen to yourself and do not overedit, censor, analyze, or critique your thoughts. I'm not going to scrutinize or sort through these. The reflection work is for you and, ultimately, for your final Leadership Development paper.</p>
<p>Take 10 minutes to complete this.&nbsp; You can revisit it later, so do not try to think too hard or to perfect your answer now. This is a well-worn, powerful thought exercise that can <span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #9242b4;"><em><strong>help you surface your "why", prompt some forward-thinking, and spark some prospection on how you would like to be remembered.</strong></em></span></p>
