<p>This is an evidence-based detailed assessment. I highly recommend taking this online survey on a computer (i.e., not a phone) and in one sitting. Do not preview it but rather sit down and take it when you have 15-20 uninterrupted minutes to answer questions thoughtfully and honestly about your personality, work preferences, and behaviors at work. This assessment has been developed by the Carlson Leadership Development team and made free to you. Your responses will directly feed several reports you will receive during the course.&nbsp;</p>
