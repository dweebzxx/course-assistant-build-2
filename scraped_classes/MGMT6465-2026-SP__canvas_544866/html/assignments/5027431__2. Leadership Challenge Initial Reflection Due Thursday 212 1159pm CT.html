</ol><p>While reflecting upon and detailing your leadership strength and weakness—and the behavioral patterns driving them, I encourage you to:</p><ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Reflect on our first set of class discussions and the results of your personality and coachability reports. How do your personality and related default tendencies serve and/or detract from your influence as a leader?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Consider how your strengths and weaknesses may be linked. Are there aspects of your leadership style that impact both your strengths and weaknesses?</span></li>
</ul><p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #1f76b1; background-color: #ffffff;"><em>Note: Stay in the present and detail where you are right now. Avoid judging yourself and thinking about where you “should be.” Instead, focus on identifying where you are right now regarding the leadership practices.</em></span></span></strong></p><p><span style="color: #000000; background-color: #fbeeb8; font-size: 12pt;">Please take time to understand the assignment submission details. Do <strong>NOT</strong> write your reflection as a Google Doc and submit a link.&nbsp;</span></p>
