<p><strong>Class/Group Contribution &amp; Professionalism. </strong>Your contribution grade will be based on your <strong><em>active</em></strong> and <strong><em>thoughtful </em></strong>contributions. Contribution requires more than asking and responding to questions—it also includes evidence of preparation for class and active participation in discussions. For each class, you should be prepared to summarize an assigned reading, describe your paper/answers to an assignment,&nbsp; answer questions posed by other students, etc. Regardless of whether I am lecturing, we are engaging in group activities or discussions, guest lecturers are presenting, or your classmates are interjecting their ideas, I expect that you will actively listen, comment, solicit the viewpoints of others. Many of you may have relevant personal experiences that could benefit all of us. I encourage you to share these during class. Participation will be assessed in three ways at the end of the course (links to online assessment will be distributed):</p>
