<h3>Course Description</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #3598db;"><em>Wanting to lead and believing you can lead are the departure points on the path to leadership. Leadership is an art - a performing art - and the instrument is the self. The mastery of the art of leadership comes with the mastery of the self. Ultimately, leadership development is a process of self-development. --</em><em><u>The Leadership Challenge</u></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #3598db;"><em>We judge ourselves by our intentions. And others by their actions.&nbsp; - Stephen R. Covey.</em></span></p>
<p>Organizations spend billions of dollars each year on leadership training and development programs. Effective leadership is considered essential for organizations, though defining effective leadership is often ambiguous and always contextually-dependent. Enacting effective leadership practices presents an enormous challenge for most individuals. Our course’s focus is to prepare and equip you to improve your confidence and capabilities to lead yourself, your projects, and others in the future.</p>
<p>We will do this by providing you with opportunities to deepen your understanding of effective leadership, examine where you are in your leadership development, and hone your skills. Although the course content is informed by leadership theory and empirical evidence, our focus centers on understanding your personal leadership strengths and vulnerabilities through feedback while developing your leadership skills through practice. The course is <em>interactive.</em> <strong>If you want a course where you can sit back and just listen, this is not it</strong>. All students will actively participate in discussions and exercises, practice leadership behaviors, reflect on their behaviors, chart ways to take action on their personal and professional priorities, and create a customized leadership development plan, which I hope proves to be the most formative deliverable of your graduate studies.</p>
<h4>Course Objectives</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>To facilitate students’ personal growth and development through the process of self-examination and external feedback</em></li>
<li><em>To teach the principles and practices of effective leadership</em></li>
<li><em>To aid students in the development of leadership skills through reflection and practice</em></li>
<li><em>To fuel students’ commitment to a specific, challenging, and ongoing process of leadership and personal development</em></li>
</ul>
<h4>Course Assumptions &amp; Expectations</h4>
<p>The fundamental assumption guiding the design of this course is that to improve your leadership skills, <strong>you must know from what point you are starting</strong>. Thus, over the course of this class, you will be evaluated extensively—by yourself, by your classmates, and by me. Will this always be comfortable? Of course not! You must be willing to accept this evaluative process and the vulnerability it entails. Though being evaluated is somewhat uncomfortable for most of us, you may find it one of the most beneficial aspects of the course.</p>
<p><strong>Below are additional assumptions that we all operate under for this course. </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We enjoy working and learning.</li>
<li>We all have different needs and styles.</li>
<li>We treat each other with dignity and respect, valuing individual, political, and cultural differences.</li>
<li>We communicate frequently and with candor, listening to one another <strong><em>to learn all we can</em></strong>.</li>
<li>We arrive on time for class sessions, stay attentive, and come prepared out of respect for our classmates.</li>
</ul>

<div id="kl_syllabus_block_sub_6" class="">
<h3>Required Materials &amp; Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kouzes, J. M. &amp; Posner, B. Z. (2012 or 2016; cheap: $0 – $25) <u>The Leadership Challenge.</u> 6<sup>th</sup> or 7<sup>th</sup> Edition. (E-book linked on the Canvas site, but you may want your own hardcopy of this book). The substantive content for both books is very similar. The 7th Edition relies on updated examples, but either version is fine and will prepare you sufficiently for discussions.</li>
<li>Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI online); pricey: $160, which already includes a 20% discount that I negotiated; <strong>must use UMINN promo code</strong>). This 360-degree leadership assessment must be ordered directly from Wiley Publishing. Order details are provided in a separate document. Ordering and completing the self-assessment swiftly will help your pre-work.</li>
<li>Experiential &amp; Reflection Exercises, Assessments, and Mini Cases (distributed in class, online, on Canvas, and/or in email; due to the cost of the 360-assessment, I have worked to find/write/make free versions of supplemental materials and exercises).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Coursework and Assignment Summary</h3>
<p>Leadership skills are best learned by <strong><em>integrating</em></strong> and <strong><em>applying</em></strong> data-driven theoretical concepts to practical situations. These skills are difficult to meaningfully assess with exams. Thus, rather than traditional examinations, we will learn the material with practical exercises and apply the course materials to our lives as a leader. Each class will consist of a discussion of the conceptual material and exercises designed to bring these concepts to life. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our expectation is that we all will attend all classes, come having read all the assigned readings before class, and be prepared to discuss it. To get the most out of the course, and to maximally benefit from the exercises, you must read and complete the assignments in advance and be an active participant in class.</p>
<p>Grades will be based on below course requirements. I have constructed the class deliverables to build on each other. In particular, thoughtful and on-time completion of class pre-work will advantage the quality and usefulness of your final leadership development paper (the big course deliverable). Please <strong><em>consult grading rubrics that I posted online </em></strong>and ask me if you have questions about any specific assignment. The follow table summarizes course deliverables and due dates.</p>

<h4 id="kl_syllabus_subnav_7_link_1">Assignment Detail</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><strong>Baseline Assessment Pre-work.</strong>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>
<p><strong>Leader Assessment of Motivations and Personality (LAMP).</strong> Complete the online survey. This feeds the course reports you will receive. I highly recommend that you take this on a computer (i.e., not a phone) and in one sitting. The survey takes about 15-20 minutes to thoughtfully complete. This information will help you understand your leadership tendencies and default reactions, as well as feed several course exercises. The survey link is posted on Canvas and embedded in the first course email.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leadership Practices Inventory 360 Online.</strong> You and <em><strong>at least six observers</strong></em> (direct reports, peers, past teammates, colleagues, supervisors, coaches, or others you have worked with in a group and who have had the opportunity to experience and/or observe your work behaviors and you impact on others) will complete an inventory designed to assess your leadership style and behaviors. The more observers, the better! I recommend that you pick <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>at least 8 raters</strong></span>. Anticipate that some people will not respond. We will talk about this more in class, and I will leave the assessment open for you to seek additional raters after the initial deadline. Details are included in the <strong>LPI 360 – Step by Step Setup Guide</strong> available on the course website and attached to the first course email.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong><strong>Leadership Challenge Initial Reflection.&nbsp;</strong></strong>
<p>The purpose of this reflection exercise is to stimulate your reflection, awareness, and analysis of your own leadership behaviors, default style, and the current scope and quality of influence. I want you to thoughtfully consider where you are in your development as a leader—right now (not where you think you “should be”).</p>
<p>Details are included in the <strong>Leadership Challenge Initial Reflection - Detailed Instructions &amp; Rubric</strong> on Canvas. To enable a clear understanding of how reflection exercises will be evaluated, I have also posted the grading rubric. Historically, students have sometimes struggled to offer evidence to their analysis (i.e., reference specific <strong>behaviors </strong>or demonstrate cause-effect of behaviors). Make sure you’re pushing beyond “I think” and “I feel” in your analysis.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Reflection Exercises &amp; Support Assignments. </strong>Throughout the class, there will be reflection exercises and assessments that I will furnish in our sessions and on Canvas that are designed to help you understand your values, default traits, work styles, etc. How you use them is optional but completing them is not. If completing them makes you think and introspect (and occasionally feel uncomfortable/vulnerable), brilliant! I’ll be thrilled. Personal growth is rarely painless and requires ever-increasing self-awareness. I will not be grading this for deep insights, length, or quality, but I encourage you not to phone these in. Quality work and introspection on these assignments will help you write a more valuable and actionable Leadership Development Plan.</li>
<li><strong>Final Leadership Development Plan. </strong>Other assignments in the course pave the way for this, our big-ticket deliverable. The purpose of your Final Leadership Development paper is to chart a longer-term vision and short-term roadmap for your personal development. This should be the most valuable assignment for you and represent something that serves you long after the course ends. It takes the form of one paper comprised of three parts. I have posted several strong exemplar papers on Canvas. To enable a detailed understanding of how your paper will be evaluated, I have posted the rubric I will follow while grading. Please see the Final Leadership Development Paper – Details &amp; Rubric on Canvas.&nbsp;
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li><strong>Long-term LD Strategy. </strong>You cannot realize your potential as a leader without a keen awareness of personal and professional weaknesses and strengths. To help you develop that awareness and chart an intentional path for your leadership development, you need a clear strategy. Your long-term leadership development strategy is a document that assesses your strengths and weaknesses as a person and a leader (from your and others’ perspectives), clarifies your vision and values, and sets goals for the future. Your Long-term LD Strategy is limited to SIX (6) double-spaced pages of text (cover page, appendices, and your 6-month Action Plan are not included in this page limit).</li>
<li><strong>Short-term LD Plan.</strong> Two things will catalyze and enable your long-term development strategy as well as course-correct you when you stray from your goals: (1) a near-time, actionable plan, and (2) a schedule pulse-check as to where you are against your plan. To enable these, there is a one-page template to help you think through and explicitly detail your 6-month Action Plan, which includes how and when you will reassess your progress against your development goals.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership Legacy Final Slide(s).</strong>&nbsp;
<p><span style="color: #3598db;">Acknowledging that we each juggle a lot, there are two deadlines for this paper, you will self-select your preferred based upon how you would like to manage your commitments and time, as well as when you need your course grade submitted.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Class Citizenship, Contribution, &amp; Professionalism. </strong>Your contribution grade will be based on your <em>active</em> and <em>thoughtful </em>participation. Participation is more than asking and responding to questions—it also includes evidence of preparation for class and active participation in discussions. For each class session, you should be prepared to summarize or talk about an assigned reading, describe your paper, answer questions posed by other students, etc. Regardless of whether I am lecturing, we are engaging in group activities or discussions, guest lecturers are presenting, or your classmates are interjecting their ideas, I expect that you will actively listen, comment, solicit the viewpoints of others, etc. You have relevant personal experiences that can benefit the collective. I encourage you to share these during class and breakout discussions. Participation will be assessed in three ways at the end of the course: (1) Instructor Assessment, (2) Peer Assessment via Peer Evaluations, and (3) Self-Assessment.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="kl_syllabus_subnav_7_link_2">Attendance Requirement &amp; Penalties</h4>
<p>By enrolling in this course, you are agreeing to attend all synchronous sessions. Because the course is compressed and requires students to be active participants, you should not enroll unless you are able to attend each of the sessions. Attendance at all sessions is required. If you miss a session for any reason, your final grade in the course will be dropped by one full letter grade.</p>
<h4 id="kl_syllabus_subnav_7_link_3">Make-up for Missed Attendance, Assignments, &amp; Exams</h4>
<p>Please review the&nbsp;<a href="https://z.umn.edu/policy-makeup_work">university policy on make-up work</a>.</p>
<h4>Written Assignments</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Class writing assignments are intentionally short. Thus, careful writing matters even more. I suggest jotting down all the points you want to make and organizing them into a coherent “story” prior to writing. For each sentence and each paragraph, ask yourself, “What am I trying to communicate?” and then do so directly, clearly, and with carefully chosen words. Be clear about what you want to communicate and then choose clear language to communicate your ideas. </em>Remember: the essence of good writing is re-writing so spend time developing your assignments.</li>
<li><em> </em><em>Two things differentiate excellent papers from acceptable ones: (1) carefully following the assignment details; and (2) providing concrete, observable specifics, especially when describing experiences, strengths, or weaknesses. General statements are best followed by specific examples. </em></li>
<li><em> </em><em>To enable you to meet all of these criteria, I have posted strong examples of final papers from past years if you need some inspiration, ideas on structure, or insights on depth.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Written assignments will be graded based on:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Creativity and insight</em></strong><strong>: </strong>Material presented is original, engaging, and interesting.</li>
<li><strong><em>Integration with course readings, lectures, and discussions</em></strong><strong>:</strong> Paper draws on, applies, and seeks to extend leadership development concepts covered in the class.</li>
<li><strong><em>Depth of</em></strong><strong><em> analysis</em></strong><strong>: </strong>Paper demonstrates thorough attention to the issues of the situation and not just obvious extensions or surface treatment of the material. <em>Campbell tip: this is where I typically see the most points lost. Think deeply, write, then review and revise. </em></li>
<li><strong><em>Organization and structure</em></strong><strong>: </strong>Paper employs a logical framework and analyzes a critical issue.</li>
<li><strong><em>Style</em></strong><strong>:</strong> Paper is well written using appropriate grammar, spelling, and punctuation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional notes on assignments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><em> </em><em>Any late work will have a grade reduced by one grade per day late (e.g. a paper one day late would drop from A to A-, two days late from A to B+). </em></li>
<li><em> </em><em>If you wish to dispute any grade, you must do so in writing within one week of when the paper was returned. Include a specific rationale for why you are disputing the grade.</em></li>

<h3>Graduate Carlson Grading Guidelines</h3>
<p>Carlson School uses a grading policy based upon a class median aggregate GPA. Learn more about the&nbsp;<a href="https://z.umn.edu/policy-carlson_graduate_grading">Carlson Course Grading Policy.</a></p>
</div>
<div id="kl_custom_block_0" class="">
<h3>A Special Note</h3>
<p>Because of our current national and political realities in the U.S., the challenging and complex international wars, and the fact that leadership is our central focus, it seems especially important to remind us of what <strong><em>academic freedom</em></strong> and the accompanying <strong><em>academic responsibility</em></strong> mean:</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ced4d9;">Academic freedom is the <strong><em>cornerstone</em></strong> of a university. At the University of Minnesota, as elsewhere, it means the freedom to explore all avenues of scholarship, research, and creative expression, and to speak or write on matters of public concern. Academic freedom includes the freedom to discuss all matters relevant to a course and may include presentation and/or discussion of diverse viewpoints on controversial matters. Students are responsible for learning the content of any course in which they enroll, and <strong><em>the learning process may include discussion about and reflection on varying points of view</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ced4d9;">Along with this freedom <strong><em>comes the responsibility to exercise academic freedom respectfully and to show consideration for the academic freedom of others</em></strong>. Students and instructors should expect their views to be challenged, and everyone—students and instructors alike—has the obligation to be respectful, fair, and civil to others when discussing divergent points of view. Academic freedom and academic responsibility are taken seriously at the University of Minnesota. Students are encouraged to contact the instructor, the department chair, their adviser, or the campus student-conflict resolution office or center if they have questions or concerns.</span></p>

<h4>Academic Misconduct and Scholastic Dishonesty</h4>
<p>The Carlson School defines academic misconduct as any act by a student that misrepresents the student's own academic work or that compromises the academic work of another. Scholastic misconduct includes (but is not limited to) cheating on assignments or examinations, plagiarizing, i.e., misrepresenting as one's own work any work done by another, submitting the same paper or substantially similar papers, to meet the requirement of more than one course without the approval and consent of the instructors concerned, or sabotaging another's work. Within this general definition, however, instructors determine what constitutes academic misconduct in the courses they teach. Students found guilty of academic misconduct face penalties ranging from lowering of the course grade or awarding a grade of F or N for the entire course, to suspension from the University.</p>
<p>Review the&nbsp;<a href="https://z.umn.edu/policy-carlson_student_conduct_code">Student Conduct Code</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://z.umn.edu/student_conduct_academic_integrity">Student Conduct and Academic Integrity website</a>.</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about how to cite sources and avoid plagiarism,&nbsp;U of M libraries offers online <a href="https://z.umn.edu/research_citation_tools">tutorials and tools related to citations</a>. You can also visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://z.umn.edu/center_for_writing">Center for Writing</a>&nbsp;for additional assistance.</p>
<h4>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h4>
<p>The University of Minnesota is committed to providing all students equal access to learning opportunities.&nbsp;<br>The Disability Resource Center (DRC) is the campus office that works with students who have disabilities to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations. Students registered with the DRC who have a letter requesting accommodations are encouraged to contact the instructor early in the semester. Students who have, or think they may have, a disability (e.g. psychiatric, attention, learning, vision, hearing, physical, or systemic), are invited to contact the DRC for a confidential discussion at 612-626-1333 (V/TTY) or at <a href="mailto:drc@umn.edu">drc@umn.edu</a>. Additional information is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://z.umn.edu/disability_resource_center">Disability Resource Center website</a>.</p>
<h4>Title IX</h4>
<p><a href="https://z.umn.edu/title_ix_process">Title IX</a> prohibits sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and relationship violence, in education.</p>
<h4>Mental Health and Stress Management</h4>
<p>As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student's ability to participate in daily activities. University of Minnesota services are available to assist you with addressing these and other concerns you may be experiencing. Learn more about the broad range of confidential&nbsp;<a href="https://z.umn.edu/mental_health_services">mental health services</a>&nbsp;available on campus.</p>
<h4>Writing Support</h4>
<p>As a student, you may experience challenges in your writing. The University of Minnesota has a&nbsp;<a href="https://z.umn.edu/student_writing_support">student writing support resource</a>&nbsp;to help with your writing.</p>
