<h3>Course Description, Goals, &amp; Objectives</h3>
<p>Data management is the foundation of data-driven enterprises and a cornerstone for business analytics.<span> Organizations store most of their data in a&nbsp;</span><i><span>relational</span></i><span>&nbsp;format. Structured Query Language (SQL), the language for querying and manipulating relational databases, is one of the most important skills for data scientists. Moreover, organizations need to scale their data infrastructure to harness big data, including using parallel processing and cloud computing. Through this course, students will gain competence in practical database, data warehousing, and data management skills with emphasis on query, data modeling, and data management. Students will also be exposed to recent advances in big data technologies and cloud-based data warehousing. </span></p>

<h4 id="kl_syllabus_subnav_7_link_1">Flex Days for Late Homework Assignments/Labs</h4>
<p><strong>You have 5 flex days</strong> that you may use at your discretion to defer the due date of a <strong>homework assignment</strong> or a <strong>lab</strong>. You must use your flex days in the whole day (24 hours) increments. You can defer a single assignment by <strong>a maximum of 2 days</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You <strong>do not need to notify the instructor </strong>if you want to use your flex days on a homework or a lab. Submit your homework/lab when ready and the proper number of flex days will be deducted. If you do not want to use your flex days on a certain assignment, please let the instructor know.</p>
<p>Flex days are intended to be used for unforeseen circumstances such as technical difficulties, family emergencies, and personal illness.&nbsp;<strong>After your flex days have been used for the semester, late work will not be accepted and will earn no credit (0 points)</strong>. Additional accommodations must be obtained in advance.</p>

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
<h4 id="kl_syllabus_subnav_7_link_3">Integrity Related to Homework Assignments</h4>
<p>I expect you to do all homework assignments<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>individually</strong>. You may still discuss homework problems with fellow students, but <strong> no documents or fragments of homework should be shared between students, physically or digitally</strong>. <span>A rule of thumb is that you should have "typed it with your own hands". </span>In case of difficulty, please reach out to the instructor as early as possible.</p>
<p>You should always save a copy of your submitted work, including lab and homework assignments. Store the copy in a secure location (such as your Google Drive).</p>
</div>
<div id="kl_syllabus_block_sub_16" class="">
<h4>Generative AI Policy</h4>
<p>Generative AI (Gen AI) tools, such as ChatGPT and Copilot, can be valuable resources for enhancing your learning experience.&nbsp; However, their use must align with the following guidelines to maintain academic integrity and ensure meaningful learning:</p>
<p>You are encouraged to use Gen AI for<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>non-quiz assignments</strong>, including <strong>homework assignments, lab problems, and knowledge check questions</strong>.You may use generative AI to explore ideas, clarify concepts, get hints, and receive help on specific tasks.</p>
<p>The use of Gen AI is <strong>strictly forbidden during quizzes</strong>. Using Gen AI during quizzes is considered a breach of academic integrity and may result in grading penalty and disciplinary actions.</p>
<p>We expect you to use Gen AI responsibly, including</p>
<ul>
<li>Always <strong>verify and refine</strong> the generated content to ensure its accuracy and alignment with the course.</li>
<li>You should <strong>take time to understand generative AI output</strong> and be ready to explain it in your own words.</li>
<li>You should <strong>incorporate your own ideas and perspectives</strong> instead of relying entirely on generative AI.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Student Academic Misconduct and Scholastic Dishonesty</h4>
<p>The Carlson School defines academic misconduct as any act by a student that misrepresents the student's own academic work or that compromises the academic work of another. Scholastic misconduct includes (but is not limited to) cheating on assignments or examinations, plagiarizing, i.e., misrepresenting as one's own work any work done by another, submitting the same paper, or substantially similar papers, to meet the requirement of more than one course without the approval and consent of the instructors concerned, or sabotaging another's work. Within this general definition, however, instructors determine what constitutes academic misconduct in the courses they teach. Students found guilty of academic misconduct face penalties ranging from lowering of the course grade or awarding a grade of F or N for the entire course, to suspension from the University.</p>
<p>Review the&nbsp;<a href="https://z.umn.edu/policy-carlson_student_conduct_code">Student Conduct Code</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://z.umn.edu/student_conduct_academic_integrity">Student Conduct and Academic Integrity website</a>.</p>

<h4>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h4>
<p>The University of Minnesota is committed to providing all students equal access to learning opportunities.&nbsp;<br>The Disability Resource Center (DRC) is the campus office that works with students who have disabilities to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations. Students registered with the DRC, who have a letter requesting accommodations, are encouraged to contact the instructor early in the semester. Students who have, or think they may have, a disability (e.g. psychiatric, attention, learning, vision, hearing, physical, or systemic), are invited to contact the DRC for a confidential discussion at 612-626-1333 (V/TTY) or at <a href="mailto:drc@umn.edu">drc@umn.edu</a>. Additional information is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://z.umn.edu/disability_resource_center">Disability Resource Center website</a>.</p>
<h4>Title IX</h4>
<p><a href="https://z.umn.edu/title_ix_process">Title IX</a> prohibits sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and relationship violence, in education.</p>
<h4>Students with Mental Health and Stress Management</h4>
<p>As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student's ability to participate in daily activities. University of Minnesota services are available to assist you with addressing these and other concerns you may be experiencing. Learn more about the broad range of confidential&nbsp;<a href="https://z.umn.edu/mental_health_services">mental health services</a>&nbsp;available on campus.</p>
