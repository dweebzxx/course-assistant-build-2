## Module 03: Overview

This module marks the final installment of our SQL query series and introduces three advanced—but powerful—tools for writing more expressive and efficient queries: **subqueries**, **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**, and **window functions**. These techniques are essential for handling complex data manipulation tasks that go beyond basic filtering and aggregation.

### Learning Objectives

* Understand and apply **subqueries** to filter/augment data.
* Write and use **Common Table Expressions** (**CTEs**) to modularize SQL logic and build layered queries.
* Use **window functions** to compute rankings, cumulative totals, moving averages, and row-level comparisons.
* Differentiate between subqueries, JOINs, and CTEs and determine when each approach is appropriate.

### To-Do This Module

* Watch lecture videos and related supportive videos
* Complete **knowledge checks** associated with each video (if available)
* Complete the **lab 3** for the module (you can do a problem set after each lecture video)
* Complete the **homework 2**.
* Complete **Quiz 1**
