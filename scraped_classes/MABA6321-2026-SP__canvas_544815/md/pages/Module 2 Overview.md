## Module 02: Overview

In this module, we will continue our journey on SQL and relational database. You will learn how to write **summary queries** using aggregate functions such as `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, and `MAX` to extract insights from datasets. We will also explore a variety of **SQL functions** that help you manipulate and analyze **numeric**, **textual**, and **datetime** values effectively. Additionally, this module will introduce the concept of **joining multiple tables** to answer more complex questions that require data from different sources. You’ll work with **inner joins**, **outer joins**, and understand how to combine data from related tables based on key relationships.
