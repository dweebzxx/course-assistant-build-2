## Overview of The SmartPAL Project

The **SmartPAL project** is an instructional initiative led by Professor De Liu, aimed at promoting self-regulated learning through a combination of chatbots and gamification. SmartPAL leverages generative AI and Canvas integration to give you personalized, context-aware responses and proactive personalized support. The project also empowers instructors by providing data-driven insights and tools to better support students.

## Eligibility

SmartPAL currently works with selected Canvas courses, whose instructors have consented to enable SmartPAL for their courses. Every student in such participating courses can leverage SmartPAL as they progress through the course.

## SmartPAL App Activation

SmartPAL offers both a mobile app and a web app, accessible through a web browser. The web app does not require installation. We encourage you to install the mobile app because you can access it without using a PC.

### SmartPAL Mobile App Installation

Search 'SmartPAL' in the iOS App Store or Google Play Store and look for the owl icon wearing an academic cap to install the app.

If you have downloaded the app in a prior semester, please **check for any available update**, as older version of the App may not work well with newly enrolled courses.

### Sign In

Sign in with your **University email** or **SSO (Single Sign ON)** credentials. If using your email, create a user account the first time you log in.

After signing in, the app will display a list of participating courses you're enrolled in for the current semester. If no courses appear, it may be because (a) you're not enrolled in any participating course, or (b) your enrollment hasn't been synced with SmartPAL. If the issue persists, please contact SmartPAL support at **smartpal@umn.edu**.

On the mobile app, it will also ask you to enable *push notification*. We encourage you to **enable push notification** so that you will always keep updated.

## Earning Gems for Learning Engagement

The app uses gems as a fun way to track your engagement in the course. You can collect gems from four types of engagement activities:

* **Canvas Pageviews**: Each week, you can earn gems for being an active user of Canvas. A *pageview* means each time you click a Canvas link (such as an assignment, announcement, module, quiz). We track the number of pageviews you generate in the course and award gems based on the following rubric.:
  + 1 to 10 pageviews, you will receive 1 gem
  + 10 to 100 pageviews, you will receive 2 gems
  + 100+ page views, you will receive 3 gems
* **On-time Assignment Submissions**: You can earn gems each week by submitting assignments on time. For eligible assignments with due dates, gems are awarded based on the following rubric:
  + missed all assignments, you earn 0 gems.
  + Submitted at least one assignment (late or on time), 1 gem
  + Submitted an assignment on time, 2 gems.
  + Submitted all assignments on time, 3 gems.
  + No assignments that week, you automatically earn 3 gems.
* **Learning Reflections**: SmartPAL asks you to reflect on your learning every week.
  + Completing this week's reflection earns you 2 gems.
* **SmartPAL Engagement**: SmartPAL Engagement reflects how often you interact with the SmartPAL app. Each week, we measure engagement by counting the number of days you use the app. Based on this, you'll earn gems according to the following rubric.:
  + Using SmartPAL (mobile or web) on 1 day during the week earns you 1 gem.
  + Using SmartPAL (mobile or web) on 2 days during the week earns you 2 gems.
  + Using SmartPAL (mobile or web) on 3+ days during the week earns you 3 gems.

## Using Weekly Reflections to Enhance Your Learning and Instruction

Each week, SmartPAL will ask you to complete a quick reflection on your learning—what worked well and what was challenging. It only takes a few minutes and helps both you and your instructor improve your learning experience. You can earn gems by completing learning reflections as part of your SmartPAL Learning Engagement.

Complete your weekly reflections on the Mobile or Web App.

## Level Up

Earning gems helps you level up—your level rises after you've accumulated enough gems. We use the following rules to determine your level:

* Level 1 (Noob): 0-17 gems
* Level 2 (Pro): 18-47 gems
* Level 3 (Epic): >= 48 gems

## Leaderboard

We publish two leaderboards to celebrate the most engaged students in the course:

* **Weekly leaderboard**: based on the number of gems earned in the current week (starting from Sunday)
* **All-time leaderboard**: based on the total number of gems earned since the beginning of the course.

The leaderboard size is fixed at 5. If there is a tie (two or more students with the same number of gems), we include the one who has the most Canvas pageviews.

## How to use the SmartPAL Chatbot?

The built-in Chatbot uses generative AI to understand and answer questions. The chatbot can currently answer the following types of questions:

* Syllabus questions: e.g., what is the late policy?
* Logistics and planning questions: e.g., What is covered in quiz 2? What is planned for this week? What are latest announcements?
* Assignment questions: e.g. when is test X? what is my grade for the group project?
* Grading related questions: e.g. What is my grade for test X? what is my grade for the group project?
* SmartPAL related questions: e.g., How do I get engagement score on this app? How do I get more gems?
* Questions related to the course topics: Can you explain the concept of \_\_\_?

As this is a prototype chatbot, some responses may be incomplete or inaccurate. We appreciate your patience and understanding as it develops.

## How do I get help or report a problem?

You may report SmartPAL problems or ask questions by emailing **smartpal@umn.edu**. We will get back to you as soon as possible, usually within 24 hours.
