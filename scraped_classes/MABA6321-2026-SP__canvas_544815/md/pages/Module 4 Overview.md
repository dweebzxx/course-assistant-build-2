## Module 04: Overview

In this module, you’ll be introduced to the Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram—a powerful visual tool for data modeling. We’ll explore its key components and best practices for designing data structures. ER diagrams will help you understand, communicate, and organize data more effectively, laying the foundation for building well-structured relational databases. Together with the next module, this will provide a complete view of how to optimally structure your data for storage and analysis.
