### Course Description, Goals, & Objectives

Data management is the foundation of data-driven enterprises and a cornerstone for business analytics. Organizations store most of their data in a *relational* format. Structured Query Language (SQL), the language for querying and manipulating relational databases, is one of the most important skills for data scientists. Moreover, organizations need to scale their data infrastructure to harness big data, including using parallel processing and cloud computing. Through this course, students will gain competence in practical database, data warehousing, and data management skills with emphasis on query, data modeling, and data management. Students will also be exposed to recent advances in big data technologies and cloud-based data warehousing.

#### Course Prerequisites

* This course has no prerequisites.

#### Course Delivery Methodology

* This course is offered in an **online asynchronous** format via Canvas, allowing students to access pre-recorded lectures, complete assignments and labs, and take quizzes according to their own pace.
* While there are **no required meetings**, students are responsible for adhering to the weekly schedule and actively participating in course activities to remain on track.

#### Course Meeting Information

* As an asynchronous online course, there is no designated meeting times for this course.

### Textbook & Reading Materials

There is no required textbook for this course.

#### Optional Course Materials

* **SQL Queries for Mere Mortals: A Hands-On Guide to Data Manipulation in SQL:** For most students, my notes on SQL would be sufficient. This book is recommended for ones who need a reference book for SQL.

#### Computing Environment

* **MySQL Community Server:**This is the database software that you should install on your computer.
* **MySQL Workbench**: This is the official MySQL GUI client that should be installed on your computer.

Though it rarely happens, this scale may be adjusted to ensure compliance with Carlson grading policies, which require a class median GPA of 3.3 +/- 0.2. Learn more about the [Carlson Course Grading Policy](https://z.umn.edu/policy-carlson_graduate_grading).

#### Flex Days for Late Homework Assignments/Labs

**You have 5 flex days** that you may use at your discretion to defer the due date of a **homework assignment** or a **lab**. You must use your flex days in the whole day (24 hours) increments. You can defer a single assignment by **a maximum of 2 days**.

You **do not need to notify the instructor** if you want to use your flex days on a homework or a lab. Submit your homework/lab when ready and the proper number of flex days will be deducted. If you do not want to use your flex days on a certain assignment, please let the instructor know.

Flex days are intended to be used for unforeseen circumstances such as technical difficulties, family emergencies, and personal illness. **After your flex days have been used for the semester, late work will not be accepted and will earn no credit (0 points)**. Additional accommodations must be obtained in advance.

#### Quizzes Format and Proctoring

All quizzes will be conducted on Canvas and will consist of multiple-choice and/or short answers. There will not be hands-on SQL scripting.

This course will use HonorCode to remotely proctor quizzes to ensure integrity and equity in knowledge assessments for all students. HonorLock is easy-to-use, scalable, privacy-focused, and FERPA-compliant. Visit the [University’s site on HonorLock.](https://z.umn.edu/proctorio-student_guide)

#### Late and/or Missed Quizzes

You should complete the quizzes by their designated due dates. If you cannot take a quiz by its due date for any reason, you should alert the instructor in advance and as soon as possible to avoid a zero grade on the quizzes. We generally follow the University policy in approving exam-related accommodations. Please review the [university policy on Excused Absences and Make-up work](https://z.umn.edu/policy-makeup_work).

#### **SmartPAL Participation Extra Credit (1%)**

We have integrated a learning support tool called **SmartPAL** into the course. The tool, created by Professor De Liu from Information and Decision Sciences, aims to boost student support and enhance engagement. It has a built-in chatbot that can answer course-related questions and send personalized reminders, and feedback, while also having some gamification features to keep you motivated. SmartPAL also asks you to complete weekly learning reflections.  We encourage you to try it out, but the usage of the tool is entirely voluntary.  For any assistance related to SmartPAL, please ask its chatbot or reach out to: [support@smartpal.org](mailto:support@smartpal.org).

### Communication

We will use a Slack Workspace **([https://maba6321spring2026.slack.com](https://maba6321spring2026.slack.com/))** for community-based interaction and day-to-day Q&A & support. We recommend that you install it on your mobile device and/or connect with the class community.

We will also use **Canvas** Announcements for official announcements. It is highly recommended that you set "Announcements" delivery to **"Notify immediately"** in [your communication settings](https://canvas.umn.edu/profile/communication).  You may reach the instructor/TA via Slack or Email.

### Academic Integrity

#### Integrity Related to Homework Assignments

I expect you to do all homework assignments **individually**. You may still discuss homework problems with fellow students, but  **no documents or fragments of homework should be shared between students, physically or digitally**. A rule of thumb is that you should have "typed it with your own hands". In case of difficulty, please reach out to the instructor as early as possible.

You should always save a copy of your submitted work, including lab and homework assignments. Store the copy in a secure location (such as your Google Drive).

#### Generative AI Policy

Generative AI (Gen AI) tools, such as ChatGPT and Copilot, can be valuable resources for enhancing your learning experience.  However, their use must align with the following guidelines to maintain academic integrity and ensure meaningful learning:

You are encouraged to use Gen AI for **non-quiz assignments**, including **homework assignments, lab problems, and knowledge check questions**.You may use generative AI to explore ideas, clarify concepts, get hints, and receive help on specific tasks.

The use of Gen AI is **strictly forbidden during quizzes**. Using Gen AI during quizzes is considered a breach of academic integrity and may result in grading penalty and disciplinary actions.

We expect you to use Gen AI responsibly, including

* Always **verify and refine** the generated content to ensure its accuracy and alignment with the course.
* You should **take time to understand generative AI output** and be ready to explain it in your own words.
* You should **incorporate your own ideas and perspectives** instead of relying entirely on generative AI.

### Student Rating of Teaching (SRT) Evaluation

The Student Rating of Teaching (SRT) evaluation will be online.

It is important that every student should complete the SRT evaluation and provide feedback to the instructor. You evaluation and feedback are always appreciated by the instructor.

### Tennessen Warning Notice Pursuant to MN Department of Administration’s Data Practices

To make this class more accessible to all enrolled students, we intend to record all class lectures and discussions.  Since your audio/video may be part of those recordings we are informing you.  Along with the instructor and teaching assistants, these recordings will be shared with only the students enrolled in the class during this semester, in accordance with FERPA regulations.

### Carlson & University Policies

#### Student Academic Misconduct and Scholastic Dishonesty

The Carlson School defines academic misconduct as any act by a student that misrepresents the student's own academic work or that compromises the academic work of another. Scholastic misconduct includes (but is not limited to) cheating on assignments or examinations, plagiarizing, i.e., misrepresenting as one's own work any work done by another, submitting the same paper, or substantially similar papers, to meet the requirement of more than one course without the approval and consent of the instructors concerned, or sabotaging another's work. Within this general definition, however, instructors determine what constitutes academic misconduct in the courses they teach. Students found guilty of academic misconduct face penalties ranging from lowering of the course grade or awarding a grade of F or N for the entire course, to suspension from the University.

Review the [Student Conduct Code](https://z.umn.edu/policy-carlson_student_conduct_code) and [Student Conduct and Academic Integrity website](https://z.umn.edu/student_conduct_academic_integrity).

If you are interested in learning more about how to cite sources and avoid plagiarism, U of M libraries offers online [tutorials and tools related to citations](https://z.umn.edu/research_citation_tools). You can also visit the [Center for Writing](https://z.umn.edu/center_for_writing) for additional assistance.

#### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

The University of Minnesota is committed to providing all students equal access to learning opportunities.   
The Disability Resource Center (DRC) is the campus office that works with students who have disabilities to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations. Students registered with the DRC, who have a letter requesting accommodations, are encouraged to contact the instructor early in the semester. Students who have, or think they may have, a disability (e.g. psychiatric, attention, learning, vision, hearing, physical, or systemic), are invited to contact the DRC for a confidential discussion at 612-626-1333 (V/TTY) or at [drc@umn.edu](mailto:drc@umn.edu). Additional information is available on the [Disability Resource Center website](https://z.umn.edu/disability_resource_center).

#### Title IX

[Title IX](https://z.umn.edu/title_ix_process) prohibits sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and relationship violence, in education.

#### Students with Mental Health and Stress Management

As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student's ability to participate in daily activities. University of Minnesota services are available to assist you with addressing these and other concerns you may be experiencing. Learn more about the broad range of confidential [mental health services](https://z.umn.edu/mental_health_services) available on campus.
