<p><strong>GUIDED DISCUSSION:</strong>&nbsp;<strong><em><span>How Much to Give to Two Chinese Cities</span></em><span> (No Prep: Facts Presented in Class)</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This course session is dedicated to surveying and applying three perspectives on how firms generally and MNEs more specifically define and discharge social responsibilities: 1) an ethical egoist perspective defining and discharging them based on how much they serve MNE shareholder wealth maximization; 2) a stakeholder utilitarian perspective doing the same based on how much they serve a range of MNE stakeholders; and 3) a corporate citizenship deontological perspective doing the same based on MNE duties to act no matter their impact on shareholders or stakeholders. We’ll survey their histories, logics, and typical applications in MNEs today. Then we’ll apply them to a fictional scenario involving Target and two cities in China where Target sources many of the goods sold in their stores. I’ll go over the facts of this scenario involving natural catastrophes leaving thousands in need of food and homes. I will ask you to apply one of these three CSR perspectives in making recommendations to senior Target executives about how much to donate for how long. I am pretty sure you’re recommendations will differ substantially depending on which CSR perspective guides you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Discussion Questions:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Define in brief CSR and these three CSR perspectives. Which do you think explains the CSR activities of MNEs in the Twin Cities?</span></li>
<li><span>For some, Milton Friedman’s 1970 opinion piece in the <em>New York Times</em> seems like a heartless statement about CSR. For others, it is a realistic statement about the limitations of the firm as a moral entity and presumptive moral wisdom of firm executives. Where do you fall between these two positions?</span></li>
<li><span>How do you think Freeman’s formulation of stakeholder theory applies to MNEs with workers domestically and multiple foreign locales? And to domestic and foreign host governments?</span></li>
<li><span>Schwab describes MNEs as “citizens” with certain global duties to act for social purposes even if the economic benefit of such action is not easy to discern. Isn’t that the province of government?</span></li>

<p><span><strong>Case Discussion:</strong> <a href="https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/video/collapse-at-rana-plaza"><strong><em>The Rana Plaza Disaster</em></strong></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Synopsis.</span></strong><span> “Bluewashing” refers to actions taken by firms that appear to serve some social purpose, but are actually meant to serve the firm’s self-interest, usually firm profitability.&nbsp; This course session is devoted to understanding whether and how that term applies to the actions of Target and other foreign retailers buying from the Bangladesh-based Rana Plaza clothing manufacturing facility while also supposedly assuring the facility’s adherence to high-quality worker safety standards. The 2013 collapse of the facility in 2013 killed hundreds and led to criticism of foreign retailers, including Target for touting statements to stakeholders about their socially responsible approach as a form of advertising. It even led to a lawsuit for damages in Canada against another Canadian retailer, Loblaws. The aim of this course session is to understand when and how MNEs assume this safety oversight role and when it whipsaws on them legally or otherwise.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Discussion Questions:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>What intrinsic duties do MNEs owe foreign workers and communities when they engage them as suppliers? </span></li>
<li><span>How far can an MNE go before it assumes some duty to those workers and communities no matter where you stand on intrinsic duties? Why would any MNE exceed the intrinsic minimum?</span></li>
<li><span>Would you permit the Rana Plaza case to be heard in Canadian rather than in Bangladeshi courts? </span></li>
<li><span>After Rana Plaza, how would you advise Target on supervision of safety in other foreign supplier?</span></li>
