<p><strong>CASE DISCUSSION</strong>: <strong><em>The Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project (A)</em></strong> HBSP #202010, 202012, 206139 and 207087.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span>Synopsis:</span></strong><span> On June 6, 2000, the World Bank's and IFC's board of directors was scheduled to vote on whether to approve funding for the $4 billion Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline project. Although the project presented a unique opportunity to alleviate poverty in Chad, one of the poorest countries in the world, Chad had a president who had been labeled "warlord" and a history of civil war and oppression. This case describes the project, the setting, and the World Bank's reasons for participating in the deal--mainly an opportunity to alleviate poverty, enforce environmental standards, and minimize the impact on indigenous people. It also describes the very public and very ardent opposition to the project's environmental, social, and revenue management policies. Faced with a high-risk, but potentially high-return opportunity to improve conditions in Chad, students, we’ll discuss decide whether it is wise to approve funding for the deal.&nbsp; This case illustrates not only the complexity of negotiating very large deals between public and private entities, but also the opportunity inherent in large-scale investment. We’ll assess whether the benefits received by the host countries are commensurate with the risks they bear. This discussion raises critical ethical issues related to investment in developing countries. With regard to project finance, the case illustrates the difference between project and corporate finance and shows that risk sharing and risk mitigation are motivations for using project finance.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Discussion Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>What is political risk? How is it related to sovereign risk? (Session 11)</span></li>
<li><span>If you were going to buy political risk insurance in the late 1990s as terms of the Chad-Cameroon pipeline project are being negotiated, then what kind of coverage when (and how much) would you buy? (Session 11)</span></li>
<li><span>How do you justify the World Bank’s inclusion of Chad and Cameroon as partial equity owners in the two pipeline companies? Didn’t Ronald Reagan tell us that the nine most terrifying words in the English language are that “I’m from the government and I’m here to help.”? (Session 11)</span></li>

<p><strong>Discussion Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>What is project finance-based investment and why do you think it is used in the Chad Cameroon pipeline project? (Session 12)</span></li>
<li><span>Which part of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in the 1990s when the Chad Cameroon pipeline investment terms were first negotiated proved most helpful when those terms were being re-negotiated in the 20002? (Session 12)</span></li>
<li><span>After all of the risk-management innovations included in this project, it still ended up having all sorts of snafus. What does that teach you about managing political risks in less developed countries? Is it nothing more than re-arranging deck chairs on the Titanic? (Session 12)</span></li>
