<h2>Week 10: Simulating the International Environment</h2>
<h3>Sessions 19: Wednesday, April 1, 2026, 5:45-7:15pm</h3>
<p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong> Delegation and International Trade</p>
<p><strong>READINGS:</strong> To Be Determined</p>
<p><strong>GUIDED DISCUSSION:</strong> Trump Tariffs and International Business Strategy</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>: As I write up this syllabus in early January 2026, it is only a few days before the US Supreme Court is likely to render an opinion on the legality of President Trump’s tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). No matter the opinion, this case highlights new challenges facing foreign businesses trying to export to the US and domestic businesses trying to buy those goods and services. Tariffs like those imposed under the IEEPA raise costs for both firms. This guided discussion is intended to give you a better grounding for how we got to this point and what foreign exporting and US importing firms are doing to mitigate the negative business effects.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the origin of the IEEPA? How does it relate to other laws giving the executive branch of the US government so much power to regulate international trade, a power explicitly delegated to the legislative branch under the US Constitution?</li>
<li>Explain the reasoning of the US Supreme Court decision on the legality of President Trump’s tariff impositions under the IEEPA.</li>
<li>How would you advise a large European MNE exporting to the US on how to mitigate the negative effects of US tariffs?</li>
<li>How would you do the same for a small US business importing those goods from Europe?</li>
</ul>
