<p><strong><span>Synopsis. </span></strong><span>Three years ago, it would’ve seemed strange to devote a course session to how (US) firms do business in wartime. Then the world changes, we get over the shock, and business pundits tell us we should’ve seen it (and planned for it) all along. So there. This session begins with four anecdotes about four firms doing business in and with Russia and Ukraine since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Each anecdote comes with a “lesson” for other firms that may face this situation in the near term. We’ll spend more time on one particular anecdote and lesson involving the Toro Corporation and its regional distributor in Russia and the Ukraine, Engo. I want you to read through the transcript of Toro’s quarterly earnings call with analysts from March 2022, only weeks after Russia’s invasion began and Western countries aghast at Russia’s aggression imposed economic sanctions leading to business closures and exits throughout Russia. Opening comments from Toro’s CEO sought to anticipate and neutralize claims that the company was still doing business in Russia. Look closely at those comments and then the lack of any analyst follow-up questions about those comments. Then look at the Engo website and contemporary statements by Engo’s CEO Norbert Zatko (translated via Google from Russian to English). Something’s amiss. We’ll discuss that and see where it takes us about how MNEs conduct themselves with integrity in wartime.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Discussion Questions:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Why do you think Toro does business internationally via distributors? What are the advantages and disadvantages of that approach? </span></li>
<li><span>Look at the Engo (Russia) website. What percentage of space and text do they devote to promoting Toro and Toro products for turf, lawncare, and golf course maintenance? Put another way, how important is Toro as a (an exclusive) supplier of products and services to Engo? </span></li>
<li><span>Think about the Toro CEO’s comments about “bad” information regarding Toro’s activities in Russia. Were they false? Were they misleading? Does it matter to you whether they are one or both?</span></li>
<li><span>Why do you think Toro analysts were so apparently uninterested in those comments? What does it tell you about business and finance community interests during wartime? </span></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://apg.nl/en/publication/what-does-european-populism-mean-for-investments/"><strong><em>What Does European Populism Mean for Investment? (CHECK THIS)</em></strong></a></p>
<p><strong><span>Synopsis. </span></strong><span>Populist politics, politicians, and parties are increasingly prominent in the industrialized democracies of Western and Central Europe. What does it mean for investment, particularly foreign-led investment? This session is dedicated to analysis and discussion of near-term populist political and investment trends. We will first review the comments of an economic expert working for a professional investment management company in the Netherlands, APG. Then, we will review findings from what may be the first broad-sample statistical study of foreign- and domestic-led infrastructure investment trends following national elections that lead to ebbs and flows of general, left-wing, and right-wing populist party political support. As you will see from both the comments and study, it is not so much populist politicians and parties that raise concerns for investors, it is <em>right-wing</em> populist politicians and parties that raise those concerns for <em>foreign-led</em> investors and their projects. We will analyze why that’s the case and what it means not only for Europe but for other parts of the world where right-wing populist parties or wings of such parties are ascendant.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Discussion Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>What does “populism” mean to you? Some analysts think there are “varieties” of populism. If so, then how would you describe the European variety based on the comments from the APG expert?</span></li>
<li><span>In my paper with Chris Hartwell, Barclay James, and Thomas Lindner there are three theories of foreign investment and political risk: opportunistic, partisan, and (partisan) populist. How do the first two contribute to the last one?</span></li>
<li><span>If you were a non-German MNE looking to invest in a Germany increasingly attracted to right-wing populist parties like the <em>Alternative für Deutschland</em> (AfD), what would you do to make that investment give it a more “domestic” look?</span></li>
<li><span>Are right-wing populist parties good for investment in Europe? Are they good for the US? </span></li>
