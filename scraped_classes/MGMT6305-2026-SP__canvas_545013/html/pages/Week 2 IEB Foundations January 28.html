<p><strong>CASE DISCUSSION:</strong> The Espresso Lane to Global Markets, W12038-PDF-ENG<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Synopsis:</strong> </span>Founded in Trieste, Italy, Illy marketed a unique blend of coffee drinks in over 140 countries and in more than 50,000 of the world's best restaurants and coffeehouses. The company wanted to expand the reach of its own franchised coffee bar, <em>Espressamente</em>, through international expansion. Potential markets included Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, India, the United Kingdom and the United States. In addition to market selection, mode of entry was vital and included options such as exporting, franchising and joint venture. This case provides a practical example of the challenges faced in international business.&nbsp; It also gives us an opportunity to understand alternative internationalization paths.&nbsp; Do MNEs and SMEs follow economic or sociological considerations when taking that path?&nbsp; Do they care more about a foreign country’s market size or cultural similarity?&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Discussion Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Is espresso coffee retailing a global industry? What do you think is the most important factor behind Illy’s efforts to internationalize operations.?</span></li>
<li><span>And what about the pattern of internationalization? How does the path of foreign market entry and development confirm, disconfirm or perhaps render irrelevant Hofstede’s ideas about cultural distance and business practices across certain country groups?</span></li>
<li><span>Maybe Illy’s luck is running out. The last big national market for its product, the US is approaching maturity in the industry product life cycle is reaching maturity in other countries worth entering.&nbsp; Defend or attack this assessment.&nbsp; No fence-sitting allowed.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>SUBJECT:&nbsp; </strong>How Do Firms Organize to Internationalize?</p>
<p><strong>READINGS:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>CASE DISCUSSION: </strong>Philips vs. Matsushita:&nbsp; The Competitive Battle Continues. HBSP #9-10-410</p>
<p><span><strong>Synopsis:</strong>&nbsp; </span>This case contrasts the development of Philips' and Matsushita's international organizations and associated organizational capabilities. Philips, with fully developed national organizations abroad, struggles to coordinate its operations on a global scale, but encounters strong resistance to organizational and cultural changes. Grim financial results in early 1990s cast doubt on the company's previous 20 years of organizational and strategic change. Matsushita, the highly centralized industry leader, struggles to internationalize its organization by decentralizing assets, responsibilities, and decision making. Its attempts to build independent national organizations abroad are equally disappointing.&nbsp; This case gives us an opportunity to raise issues relating internal strategy processes and structures to external global strategy content.&nbsp; In short, how does MNE internal process and structure influence external conflict between the MNE and other firms?</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Discussion Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>How did Philips become the leading consumer electronics company in the world in the postwar era? What distinctive resources/abilities/competencies did Philips build?&nbsp; What distinctive disadvantages?</span></li>
<li><span>How did Matsushita succeed in displacing Philips as No. 1? What were its distinctive resources/abilities/competencies?&nbsp; And its distinctive disadvantages?</span></li>
<li><span>What do you think of the change each MNE has made to date -objectives, implementation, impact? Why is the change so hard for both of them?</span></li>
<li><span>What recommendations would you make to the Philips CEO? To the Matushita CEO?</span></li>
</ul>
