<p><strong><span>Synopsis:</span></strong><span>&nbsp; Some industries –but only some- are inherently global in nature. They are given to one, two or only a few MNEs dominating the market.&nbsp; Long-haul civil aircraft manufacturing may be one those industries.&nbsp; If so, then it’s a “winner-take-all” or “winner-take-most” fight by the two MNEs seeking that domination: US-based Boeing and Europe-based Airbus.&nbsp; Both have benefited from government support. Airbus was created as an entity owned by several European states. Boeing was always a privately-owned entity but received substantial US government revenue as a prime defense contractor.&nbsp; Both MNEs think that support (and more) justified as they mull over whether and how to develop a new generation of superjumbo jet offerings for the travelling public.&nbsp; Isn’t it “good” public policy for home-country governments to subsidize their national champion MNEs if that subsidy could help their MNE win the global market and shower the home country with all sorts of positive externalities:&nbsp; more employment, technology, wealth, military power, independence and influence.&nbsp; That’s the setting for our case where Boeing and Airbus (and their respective home-country governments) are mulling over whether to cooperate or compete in the production of superjumbo jets in the 1990s and 2000s, and then live with that decision in the 2010s.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Discussion Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>What are the characteristics of a global industry?</span></li>
<li><span>Are there differences that matter between the subsidies that Airbus and Boeing receive? How do their respective home-country governments justify those subsidies?</span></li>
<li><span>What is “industrial policy” according to Krugman, Obstfeld and Melitz? How does their view of industrial policy differ with Michael Porter’s explanation of government’s role in fostering firm competitive advantages?</span></li>
<li><span>What is “strategic trade policy” and how does it matter in the Brander-Spence model of trade?</span></li>
<li><span>How do you explain the different decisions about whether to produce superjumbo jets at Airbus and Boeing?</span></li>
</ul>
