Professor Vaaler's research and teaching interests lie at the intersection of business, law and politics:  understanding long-term performance stability trends and their competition (antitrust) policy implications for firms in the US; understanding how migrants from developing countries remit money and ideas to fund, found and grow new businesses in developing countries with poor legal infrastructure; and how elections change the attractiveness of new democracies for lending and investment. His courses address business, legal and public policy issues associated with managing intellectual property in firms, negotiating investment projects with the governments of developing countries, and structuring public-private partnerships.  He is the author and editor of books published by MIT Press, Kluwer Academic Publishers and Routledge Press, and journal articles published in *Academy of Management Journal, Economics Letters, Journal of Business Venturing, Journal of International Business Policy, Journal of International Business Studies, Journal of International Management, Journal of International Money and Finance, Journal of Management Studies, Management International Review, Organization Science, Review of Development Economics, Review of Law & Economics, Strategic Management Journal, Strategy Science, Transnational Corporations* and other academic journals. He serves as a Senior Editor for the *Journal of International Business Policy*, a Consulting Editor for the *Journal of World Business*, and Co-Editor-in-Chief of the Social Science Research Network Global Business Issues electronic journal.

Professor Vaaler is a lawyer with private practice and government experience. He received his BA in History from Carleton College, his MA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from Oxford University where he studied as a Rhodes Scholar, his JD from Harvard Law School, and his PhD from the University of Minnesota.  He consults with companies, governments and international organizations on issues related to his research.  He has served as a consultant to the World Bank on diaspora policy recommendations designed to increase remittances of money and innovations enhancing economic development in West Africa.
