**Submit Answers to Discussion Questions If Last (Family) Name Starts with G-I.**

**Synopsis**. How do MNEs sue a sovereign state? Up until the early 1960s the question was irrelevant. MNEs couldn’t. Then countries started signing international investment agreements (IIAs) including investor state dispute resolution terms permitting such suits under certain conditions. The *Finley* case helps us understand how such suits can go forward under two of the most important IIAs: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) enacted in the early 1990s under the Clinton administration; and the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) enacted in the late 2010s under the (first) Trump administration. The *Finley* cases applies both IIAs, so we can get a sense of how both differ in the rights and obligations they impose on MNEs trying to hold states to account. The Finley case is long. First, browse through it just to get a sense of how long and winding a road it is for MNEs like Finley to exploit IIAs, particularly the newer USMCA. Then try to acquaint yourselves with the facts of the alleged breach of contract by Mexico’s state-owned subsidiary of Pemex, PEP.  Finally, look at the conclusion of the decision by the ICSID tribunal ultimately awarding damages –money— to Finley. Was it all worth it for Finley?

**Discussion Questions:**

* Which dispute resolution mechanisms were more effective for Finley in its dispute with the Mexican government?
* How do NAFTA-based dispute resolution terms differ with USMCA-based terms?
* Look at the McMillans LLP publication analyzing different ways to sue states under the USMCA. A direct lawsuit by an MNE against a state isn’t the only way to try and hold a state accountable. What’s wrong with using those alternatives?
* If, after studying the *Finley* case, you were advising other small- or medium-sized MNEs about how IIAs “protect” themselves in transactions with foreign states, what advice would you emphasize?

### Session 10: Wednesday, February 18, 2026, 7:35-9:05pm

**SUBJECT:** The International Bribery and Corruption Environment

**READINGS:**

SEC. 2023 [***Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)***](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement/foreign-corrupt-practices-act).US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): Washington, DC.

SEC. 2023. [***SEC Charges 3M with Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Violations Relating to China Subsidiary***](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023-160). US Securities and Exchange Commission: Washington, DC. August 25.

**CASE DISCUSSION**: [***3M China Bribery Case.***](https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2023/08/25/3m-will-pay-65-million-over-allegedly-funding-tourism-for-chinese-officials/)

**Submit Answers to Discussion Questions If Last (Family) Name Starts with J-L.**

**Synopsis**. Issues of bribery and corruption often confront MNEs, particularly when dealing with host-country government officials, and particularly in developing countries. The US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is a US response to that issue with its origins in two notorious instances of bribery involving the sale of military planes to Japan and civil aircraft to Pakistan. Since then, the FCPA has undergone several revisions and other wealthier industrialized countries in Western Europe and the Pacific have enacted similar laws. The 2023 3M China bribery case is important to understand not just to see how the FCPA works in practice but to understand how easy it is to detect by MNE headquarters and then respond to effectively. It is pretty clear that 3M’s healthcare subsidiary operations in China were bribing Chinese health ministry officials for years before 3M’s headquarters in suburban St. Paul discovered it. After this case was settled, 3M “spun off” its healthcare division into a separate MNE. Reviewing this case in light of the subsequent spin off will help us understand how MNE organization and oversight capability matter for the control of bribery abroad.

 **Discussion Questions:**

* Look at the summary description of the FCPA and the summary of 3M’s FCPA violation in two documents published online by the SEC. What were the elements of 3M’s FCPA violation?
* At first glance, the fines and disgorgement 3M paid out to settle the FCPA violations seemed to be pretty small compared to the business advantages 3M likely gained over the years it bribed Chinese health officials with luxury trips to “educational” conferences. What other costs do you think 3M’s FCPA violations prompted?
* In 2023, 3M’s healthcare division was one of many in a highly diversified MNE. The spin-off of the healthcare division into a separate company in 2024 meant that the new MNE would serve only one industry. How does that matter for future oversight of operations for future FCPA violations?
