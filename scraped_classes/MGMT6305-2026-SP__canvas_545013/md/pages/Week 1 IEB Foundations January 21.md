Dunning, J. 1988.

Siegel, J. & Collins, D. 2006. Introduction to international strategy:  Module note. Harvard Business School Publishing Product Number (HBSP) #9-706-481.

**CASE DISCUSSION:** Lincoln Electric, HBSP #9-707-445

**Synopsis**:  This case kicks off Module 1 and our study of foundational IEB concepts and issues.  Perhaps *the* foundational issue is why firms go abroad as an MNC or SME.  Why not stay at home and trade goods and services with foreign firms in international markets?  And if the firm is so “bold” as to go abroad as an MNC or SME, then how does it go abroad, that is, with what form of foreign direct investment (FDI). Lincoln Electric is a Cleveland-based welding services firm that has already gone abroad as an MNC but is now considering India as  new international market.  Lincoln’s CEO is mulling over whether to invest in India, and if so, with what form of FDI.  You will help him with that decision.  First, we’ll ground it in a broader theoretical framework explaining when it makes sense for firms to go abroad as an MNC or SME.  It is the ownership-location-internalization (OLI) framework.  The OLI framework might also help in addressing the second question about how to enter.

**Discussion Questions:**

* Should Lincoln Electric enter India?
* If so, should Lincoln Electric own a manufacturing operation there? If so, then should the company acquire a local player or build their own greenfield plant?
* If a joint venture is preferred, then think about how Lincoln Electric will ensure its ability to make key business decisions in India.
* John Dunning analyzes the decision to internationalize a firm’s operations as a function of that firm’s ownership, location and internalization (OLI) factors. How do you apply the OLI factors to Lincoln Electric and its decision about whether to enter India.
