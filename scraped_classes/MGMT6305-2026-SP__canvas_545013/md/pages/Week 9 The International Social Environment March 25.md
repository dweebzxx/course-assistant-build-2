**SUBJECT:** Migrant Remittances and International Entrepreneurship

**READINGS:**

**CASE DISCUSSION:** [***The Supply Side: WalMex, India’s PhonePe Grow Ecosystems Inside Walmart International***](https://talkbusiness.net/2024/07/the-supply-side-walmex-indias-phonepe-grow-ecosystems-inside-walmart-international).

**Synopsis**. The fifth largest country in the world is the virtual country of Diasporia.  There are about 300,000,000 people living in countries where they were not born or raised. The bulk are migrants from countries of the Developing South (*e.g*., Philippines) living and working in countries of the Developed North (*e.g*., US). And those migrants are remitting to their home countries more than $650 billion annually.  Migrant remittances are now the largest foreign capital inflow into most developing countries.  What are the remittances used for? The lion’s share of a remitted dollar (or Euro or Yen) goes to finance household consumption of necessities like food and clothing and healthcare. But a substantial percentage also goes to funding, founding, and growing micro businesses in those same households. So migrants, remittances, and venture investment in developing countries are now an increasingly important part of the social environment of businesses large and small.  In this session we’ll learn how and why.  We’ll also learn how you can exploit business-related opportunities. The WalMex and PhonePe initiatives are two examples of intermediaries looking to exploit business opportunities related to remittances. We will evaluate these and then give you the opportunity to dream up your own “value-added” business idea. Maybe you’ll be the next MNE to win big from remittances.

**Discussion Questions:**

* What is a migrant? What are remittances?  Why have both grown so quickly since 2000?
* How does economic “informality” change remittance use in a household in a developing country?
* The WalMex and PhonePe initiatives are two attempts to build profitable ecosystems around migrants and their remittances. How do you evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each?
* What’s your value-added remittance idea? It doesn’t require you to be a big MNE like WalMart, just someone able to match a remitting migrant’s interest in the host country to a migrant recipient’s need in the home country. Let’s call it “transnational knowledge.”

**SUBJECT:** Discrimination and International Marketing

**READINGS:**

Economist. 2017. [Uncharted Territory: Why Some Airlines Remove Israel from their Online Route Maps](http://https/www.economist.com/gulliver/2017/03/08/why-some-airlines-remove-israel-from-their-online-route-maps). March 8.

Note on the Global Airline Industry 2020. #W21009-PDF-ENG.

**GUIDED DISCUSSION:** Delta Airlines and Their Middle Eastern SkyTeam Allies.

**Synopsis:** Alliances have been central features of US, European, and other international airline strategies since the 2010s. Reasons for their emergence are varied, but two major reasons stand out: national state regulation of air space and landing rights; and national state ownership of airlines. The first major reason lets national governments favor domestic airlines and airline business objectives. The second lets national governments control domestic airlines and government political objectives. Sometimes the two overlap as in the case of two Delta SkyTeam alliance members, Saudia and MEA (Lebanon). It may seem irrelevant, but both single out Israel for omission as a country on their airline route maps. We’ll analyze why they and a select group of other state-owned airlines from the Middle East “deny” Israel’s existence on their route maps: Is it to support home-country political objectives, airline business (profitability) objectives, or both? Get ready to learn more about “discriminatory product differentiation” among airlines Delta embraces as allies.

**Discussion Questions**:

* How would you describe the structure of the international airline industry in the mid-2010s?
* Which alliance is best positioned for success in the 2020s?
* The 2017 *Economist* article suggests that some international airlines in the 2010s compete by subtly discriminating against Israelis and Jews. But many of these same airlines are also in alliances led by US airlines touting their record of non-discrimination. Which alliance is best positioned to avoid such intra-alliance conflicts in the 2020s?
