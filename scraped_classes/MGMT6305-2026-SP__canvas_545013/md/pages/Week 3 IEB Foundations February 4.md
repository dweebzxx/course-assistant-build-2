**SUBJECT:** How Do Firms and States Internationalize in Global Industries?

**CASE DISCUSSION:** Airbus vs. Boeing (A), HBSP #9-707-747

Airbus vs. Boeing (B):  Should Airbus Build the VLCT Alone?, HBSP #9-707-448

            Airbus vs. Boeing (F):  2002-2006, HBSP # 9-707-452

            Airbus vs. Boeing (L):  Discontinuing the A380 (February 2019), HBSP #9-720-387

**Synopsis:**  Some industries –but only some- are inherently global in nature. They are given to one, two or only a few MNEs dominating the market.  Long-haul civil aircraft manufacturing may be one those industries.  If so, then it’s a “winner-take-all” or “winner-take-most” fight by the two MNEs seeking that domination: US-based Boeing and Europe-based Airbus.  Both have benefited from government support. Airbus was created as an entity owned by several European states. Boeing was always a privately-owned entity but received substantial US government revenue as a prime defense contractor.  Both MNEs think that support (and more) justified as they mull over whether and how to develop a new generation of superjumbo jet offerings for the travelling public.  Isn’t it “good” public policy for home-country governments to subsidize their national champion MNEs if that subsidy could help their MNE win the global market and shower the home country with all sorts of positive externalities:  more employment, technology, wealth, military power, independence and influence.  That’s the setting for our case where Boeing and Airbus (and their respective home-country governments) are mulling over whether to cooperate or compete in the production of superjumbo jets in the 1990s and 2000s, and then live with that decision in the 2010s. 

 **Discussion Questions:**

* What are the characteristics of a global industry?
* Are there differences that matter between the subsidies that Airbus and Boeing receive? How do their respective home-country governments justify those subsidies?
* What is “industrial policy” according to Krugman, Obstfeld and Melitz? How does their view of industrial policy differ with Michael Porter’s explanation of government’s role in fostering firm competitive advantages?
* What is “strategic trade policy” and how does it matter in the Brander-Spence model of trade?
* How do you explain the different decisions about whether to produce superjumbo jets at Airbus and Boeing?
