## Week 4: The International Legal Environment

### Session 7: Wednesday, February 11, 2026, 5:45-7:15pm

**SUBJECT:** The International Contracting Environment

**READING:**

Read relevant sections of [**Uniform Commercial Code, Article 2 (Sales)**](https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2) referenced in *Brands*.

Read relevant sections of the [**United Nations Convention on Contracts**](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/files/58744036?wrap=1 "UNCCISG.pdf") for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).

**CASE DISCUSSION**: [***Brands International Corporation v. Reach Companies, LLC***](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca8/23-2164/23-2164-2024-05-30.html), No. 23-2164, US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (2024).

**Submit Answers to Discussion Questions If Last (Family) Name Starts with A-C.**

**Synopsis**:  We begin module 2 with an introduction to legal issues associated with a cross-border sales transactions. The *Brands* case provides us with an opportunity to see how such transactions are negotiated between merchants, and how state and national versus international legal regimes regarding sales contracts and their interpretation differ. Among other points, *Brands* highlights the importance of carefully writing draft agreements, especially when those drafts address choice of law for their interpretation when breached. In this case, a contract for delivery of hand sanitizer on behalf of Canada-based Brands by Minnesota-based Reach failed to expressly exclude application of a separate international legal regime summarized under the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). So the CISG rather than Minnesota law governed the contract. The big issue for the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit was about whether Brands could collect attorneys’ fees from Reach for Reach’s breach of contract. The Eighth Circuit’s 2024 opinion about whether Brands could recover those fees under the CISG reversed a 2023 decision by the lower US District Court for the District of Minnesota. At first glance, the 2024 decision seemed surprising. We’ll show why it wasn’t and what it means going forward for small, medium, and large MNEs doing business around the world.

 **Discussion Questions:**

* Why does the CISG apply to the transaction in dispute between Brands and Reach (and how do you know)?
* Assuming that Minnesota law governed the contract, do you think Brands would still have been able to recover attorneys’ fees from Reach?
* What sources of law did the Eighth Circuit refer to in reversing the lower court and awarding Brands attorneys fees?
* It’s pretty clear that the attorneys for both Brands and Reach –both large MNEs— didn’t understand how choice of law rules worked in an international transaction. What does that tell you about how law matters in international transaction negotiation and dispute resolution?

### Session 8: Wednesday, February 11, 2026, 7:35-9:05pm

**SUBJECT:** The International Private Arbitration Environment

**READING:**

American Arbitration Association. 2013. [***Drafting Dispute Resolution Clauses:  A Practical Guide***](https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/document_repository/Drafting%20Dispute%20Resolution%20Clauses%20A%20Practical%20Guide.pdf). American Arbitration Association: Minneapolis, MN.

**CASE DISCUSSION**: [***Mitsubishi v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth***](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/473/614/), 473 U.S. 614 (1985).

**Submit Answers to Discussion Questions If Last (Family) Name Starts with D-F.**

**Synopsis**:  Litigation of cross-border sales and other transactions increasingly takes place in front of arbitral panels in boardrooms rather than judges and juries in courtrooms.  In this session we ask why.  Mitsubishi gives us a US perspective on this question.  And the AAA reading tells us how best to write agreements consistent with that US perspective.

 **Discussion Questions:**

* What is the function of a dispute resolution clause?
* What is arbitration compared to other non-judicial forms of dispute resolution?
* Why do parties so often use arbitration in international transactions?
* Mitsubishi seems to stand for the proposition that parties can contract away virtually all substantive rights to sue in US courts, including federal statutory rights. Is that an accurate reading of Mitsubishi?
