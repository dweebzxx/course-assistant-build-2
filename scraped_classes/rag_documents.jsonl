We will do this by learning to form testable hypotheses, collect relevant data quickly, and perform fundamental analytics. Techniques may include qualitative research, survey design, sample design, online data collection, descriptive statistics, and tests for statistical significance. By the end of class, students will be able to provide convincing recommendations for common marketing decisions.\n\nThe course is most appropriate for people who focus on marketing strategy and management. It is also appropriate for people whose job functions involve working with market research and analytics professionals, who need to assess the quality of marketing research, and whose job requires them to work with, interpret, and take action based on data.\n\n#### Course Prerequisites\n\nMBA 6210, MBA student, Instructor permission\n\n#### Course Delivery Methodology\n\nClass will involve lectures, discussions, and hands-on projects.\n\n### Course Meeting Information\n\n**Time:** Tuesday/Thursday 9:55am - 11:35am\n\n**Place:** CSOM 1-147\n\n#### Additional Meetings:\n\n* You may need to work with peers on some course projects. The time and place/method of the meeting will be determined by you and your peers.\n\n### Tennessen Warning Notice Pursuant to MN Department of Administration’s Data Practices\n\nTo make this class more accessible to all enrolled students, we might record class lectures and discussions.  Since your audio/video may be part of those recordings we are informing you.  Along with the instructor and teaching assistants, these recordings will be shared with only the students enrolled in the class during this semester, in accordance with FERPA regulations.\n\n### Communication and Canvas Notifications\n\nThe Canvas Notifications system is the main communication tool we will use for course-relevant announcements. If you have not altered your notification settings, you will receive announcements in your UMN email immediately when they are made. If you have altered these settings, it is highly recommended that you reset \"Announcements\" back to \"Notify immediately\" in [your communication settings](https://canvas.umn.edu/profile/communication) as seen below so that you receive notices in a timely manner.\n![Notification frequency settings. 4 options: Notify immediately, Daily summary, Weekly summary, Notifications off](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/sites/carlsonschool.umn.edu/files/announcements_notifications.png)\nYou may also choose to receive notifications through additional channels including a personal email address or push notifications on your phone if you install the Canvas app. Additional channels can be added through your [Canvas Settings](https://canvas.umn.edu/profile/settings).\n\n### Final Exam\n\nThe final project and final project comments will serve as our exam.\n\n### Course Materials\n\n#### Required Course Materials\n\nThere are no required textbooks for this class. All materials related to the course will be available on Canvas.\n\n#### Required Computer and Software\n\nStudents will need to analyze data using Excel on their own computers. In addition, students will need to install the Microsoft Data Analysis Add-in. Note – this add-in is free and should be available to all students after leaving this class. If you are not familiar with Excel, consider getting some training with this tool. We might use R later in the semester, but no prior coding skills are required.\n\n#### Optional Course Materials\n\nI recommend reading articles and books about decision making and biases because they will help you design persuasive marketing appeals. While academic articles are often more rigorous and detailed than books, popular books are generally more approachable and can synthesize multiple fields of study. Recommended authors include people like Ariely, Gilbert, Gladwell, Griskevicius, Kahneman, and Simonson. If you are looking for a place to start, I recommend *Predictably Irrational* by Dan Ariely.\n\n### Assignments & Grading\n\n#### Grading Criteria\n\n**Quizzes**25%\n\n**Research Exercises**  25%\n\n**Final Project** 30% and **Constructive Reviews** 20%\n\n#### Quizzes\n\nWe will have multiple online quizzes throughout the semester which should be completed individually. The goal of these quizzes is to assess your knowledge of the fundamentals of the course. Due dates are posted on Canvas.\n\n#### Group Research Exercises\n\nWe will have multiple research exercises throughout the semester. The goal of these exercises is to practice course-related skills in a more real-world setting. Assignments and due dates are posted on Canvas. Your grade will be based on your submission. Groups will submit a research plan.\n\n#### Group Final Project\n\nThe final project will be a real-world market research project. You will define and research a marketing problem, propose potential solutions, and execute and evaluate outcomes. Details depend on the project each semester but often involve running qualitative and survey research. Groups will submit a final report and will individually critique one final report.\n\n#### Due Dates and Late Work\n\nDues dates are listed under Assignments and on the Calendar in Canvas. \n\n#### Attendance Requirement & Penalties\n\nStudents must submit assignments on time.\n\n#### Make-up for Missed Attendance, Assignments, & Exams\n\nPlease review the [university policy on make-up work](https://z.umn.edu/policy-makeup_work).\n\n#### AI and ChatGPT\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) language models, such as ChatGPT, may be used for Research Exercise and the Final Project with appropriate citation, but not for quizzes. If you are in doubt as to whether you are using AI language models appropriately in this course, I encourage you to discuss your situation with me. Citations should be included with your submission and should describe exactly how you use the tool(s) for this course requirement. You are responsible for fact checking statements composed by AI language models.\n\n### Graduate Carlson Grading Guidelines\n\nCarlson School uses a grading policy based upon a class median aggregate GPA. Learn more about the [Carlson Course Grading Policy.](https://z.umn.edu/policy-carlson_graduate_grading)\n\n### Carlson & University Policies\n\n#### Academic Misconduct and Scholastic Dishonesty\n\nThe Carlson School defines academic misconduct as any act by a student that misrepresents the student's own academic work or that compromises the academic work of another. Scholastic misconduct includes (but is not limited to) cheating on assignments or examinations, plagiarizing, i.e., misrepresenting as one's own work any work done by another, submitting the same paper, or substantially similar papers, to meet the requirement of more than one course without the approval and consent of the instructors concerned, or sabotaging another's work. Within this general definition, however, instructors determine what constitutes academic misconduct in the courses they teach. Students found guilty of academic misconduct face penalties ranging from lowering of the course grade or awarding a grade of F or N for the entire course, to suspension from the University.\n\nReview the [Student Conduct Code](https://z.umn.edu/policy-carlson_student_conduct_code) and [Student Conduct and Academic Integrity website](https://z.umn.edu/student_conduct_academic_integrity).\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about how to cite sources and avoid plagiarism, U of M libraries offers online [tutorials and tools related to citations](https://z.umn.edu/research_citation_tools). You can also visit the [Center for Writing](https://z.umn.edu/center_for_writing) for additional assistance.\n\n#### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities\n\nThe University of Minnesota is committed to providing all students equal access to learning opportunities. \nThe Disability Resource Center (DRC) is the campus office that works with students who have disabilities to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations. Students registered with the DRC, who have a letter requesting accommodations, are encouraged to contact the instructor early in the semester. Students who have, or think they may have, a disability (e.g. psychiatric, attention, learning, vision, hearing, physical, or systemic), are invited to contact the DRC for a confidential discussion at 612-626-1333 (V/TTY) or at [drc@umn.edu](mailto:drc@umn.edu). Additional information is available on the [Disability Resource Center website](https://z.umn.edu/disability_resource_center).\n\n#### Title IX\n\n[Title IX](https://z.umn.edu/title_ix_process) prohibits sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and relationship violence, in education.\n\n#### Mental Health and Stress Management\n\nAs a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student's ability to participate in daily activities. University of Minnesota services are available to assist you with addressing these and other concerns you may be experiencing. Learn more about the broad range of confidential [mental health services](https://z.umn.edu/mental_health_services) available on campus.\n\n#### Writing Support\n\nAs a student, you may experience challenges in your writing. The University of Minnesota has a [student writing support resource](https://z.umn.edu/student_writing_support) to help with your writing.\n\n#### Additional University Policies\n\n1.

Organizations store most of their data in a *relational* format. Structured Query Language (SQL), the language for querying and manipulating relational databases, is one of the most important skills for data scientists. Moreover, organizations need to scale their data infrastructure to harness big data, including using parallel processing and cloud computing. Through this course, students will gain competence in practical database, data warehousing, and data management skills with emphasis on query, data modeling, and data management. Students will also be exposed to recent advances in big data technologies and cloud-based data warehousing.\n\n#### Course Prerequisites\n\n* This course has no prerequisites.\n\n#### Course Delivery Methodology\n\n* This course is offered in an **online asynchronous** format via Canvas, allowing students to access pre-recorded lectures, complete assignments and labs, and take quizzes according to their own pace.\n* While there are **no required meetings**, students are responsible for adhering to the weekly schedule and actively participating in course activities to remain on track.\n\n#### Course Meeting Information\n\n* As an asynchronous online course, there is no designated meeting times for this course.\n\n### Textbook & Reading Materials\n\nThere is no required textbook for this course.\n\n#### Optional Course Materials\n\n* **SQL Queries for Mere Mortals: A Hands-On Guide to Data Manipulation in SQL:** For most students, my notes on SQL would be sufficient. This book is recommended for ones who need a reference book for SQL.\n\n#### Computing Environment\n\n* **MySQL Community Server:**This is the database software that you should install on your computer.\n* **MySQL Workbench**: This is the official MySQL GUI client that should be installed on your computer.\n* **Databricks Free Edition**: This is the free-to-use cloud service offered by Databricks that we will use briefly for the Big Data module. [Sign up here](https://www.databricks.com/learn/free-edition) (make sure you don't provide any credit card, if you're asked for it, then you may somehow chose to sign up for a regular account).\n* **Snowflake**: We may provide a Snowflake computing environment cloud-based data warehousing.\n\n#### Installations Instructions\n\n* Windows: You may install **MySQL Community Server** (8.0.4) and **MySQL Workbench** (8.0.4) by following [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8cLGUuGsrQ).\n* Mac: You may install **MySQL Community Server** (8.0.4) and **MySQL Workbench** (8.0.4) by following [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wpzS5NcYT8).\n\n### Assignments & Grading\n\n#### Grading Criteria\n\nYour grade will be based on the following activities:\n\n| Activity | Grade % |\n| --- | --- |\n| Homework Assignments | 20% |\n| Labs | 30% |\n| Quiz 1 (Modules 1-3) | 20% |\n| Quiz 2 (Modules 4-5) | 15% |\n| Quiz 3 (Modules 6-7) | 15% |\n\n#### Grading Scheme\n\nA final letter grade is given according to the following scale.\n\n| Percent | Grade |\n| --- | --- |\n| 93.0 or above | A |\n| 90.0 - 92.9 | A- |\n| 87.0 - 89.9 | B+ |\n| 83.0 - 86.9 | B |\n| 80.0 - 82.9 | B- |\n| 77.0 - 79.9 | C+ |\n| 73.0 - 76.9 | C |\n| 70.0 - 72.9 | C- |\n| 60.0 - 69.9 | D |\n| Below 60.0 | F |\n\nThough it rarely happens, this scale may be adjusted to ensure compliance with Carlson grading policies, which require a class median GPA of 3.3 +/- 0.2. Learn more about the [Carlson Course Grading Policy](https://z.umn.edu/policy-carlson_graduate_grading).\n\n#### Flex Days for Late Homework Assignments/Labs\n\n**You have 5 flex days** that you may use at your discretion to defer the due date of a **homework assignment** or a **lab**. You must use your flex days in the whole day (24 hours) increments. You can defer a single assignment by **a maximum of 2 days**.\n\nYou **do not need to notify the instructor** if you want to use your flex days on a homework or a lab. Submit your homework/lab when ready and the proper number of flex days will be deducted. If you do not want to use your flex days on a certain assignment, please let the instructor know.\n\nFlex days are intended to be used for unforeseen circumstances such as technical difficulties, family emergencies, and personal illness. **After your flex days have been used for the semester, late work will not be accepted and will earn no credit (0 points)**. Additional accommodations must be obtained in advance.\n\n#### Quizzes Format and Proctoring\n\nAll quizzes will be conducted on Canvas and will consist of multiple-choice and/or short answers. There will not be hands-on SQL scripting.\n\nThis course will use HonorCode to remotely proctor quizzes to ensure integrity and equity in knowledge assessments for all students. HonorLock is easy-to-use, scalable, privacy-focused, and FERPA-compliant. Visit the [University’s site on HonorLock.](https://z.umn.edu/proctorio-student_guide)\n\n#### Late and/or Missed Quizzes\n\nYou should complete the quizzes by their designated due dates. If you cannot take a quiz by its due date for any reason, you should alert the instructor in advance and as soon as possible to avoid a zero grade on the quizzes. We generally follow the University policy in approving exam-related accommodations. Please review the [university policy on Excused Absences and Make-up work](https://z.umn.edu/policy-makeup_work).\n\n#### **SmartPAL Participation Extra Credit (1%)**\n\nWe have integrated a learning support tool called **SmartPAL** into the course. The tool, created by Professor De Liu from Information and Decision Sciences, aims to boost student support and enhance engagement. It has a built-in chatbot that can answer course-related questions and send personalized reminders, and feedback, while also having some gamification features to keep you motivated. SmartPAL also asks you to complete weekly learning reflections.  We encourage you to try it out, but the usage of the tool is entirely voluntary.  For any assistance related to SmartPAL, please ask its chatbot or reach out to: [support@smartpal.org](mailto:support@smartpal.org).\n\n### Communication\n\nWe will use a Slack Workspace **([https://maba6321spring2026.slack.com](https://maba6321spring2026.slack.com/))** for community-based interaction and day-to-day Q&A & support. We recommend that you install it on your mobile device and/or connect with the class community.\n\nWe will also use **Canvas** Announcements for official announcements. It is highly recommended that you set \"Announcements\" delivery to **\"Notify immediately\"** in [your communication settings](https://canvas.umn.edu/profile/communication).  You may reach the instructor/TA via Slack or Email.\n\n### Course Schedule\n\n| Module | Description | Lab | Homework | Quiz |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Module 1 | Introduction to Databases and SQL | **Lab 1** |  |  |\n| Module 2 | Intermediate SQL | **Lab 2** | **Homework 1** |  |\n| Module 3 | Advanced SQL | **Lab 3** | **Homework 2** | **Quiz 1** |\n| Module 4 | Modeling Data with ERD | **Lab 4** |  |  |\n| Module 5 | Normalization and Database Design | **Lab 5** | **Homework 3** | **Quiz 2** |\n| Module 6 | Big Data and Hive | **Lab 6** |  |  |\n| Module 7 | Cloud-based Data Warehousing: Snowflake | **Lab 7** |  | **Quiz 3** |\n\n### Academic Integrity\n\n#### Integrity Related to Homework Assignments\n\nI expect you to do all homework assignments **individually**. You may still discuss homework problems with fellow students, but  **no documents or fragments of homework should be shared between students, physically or digitally**. A rule of thumb is that you should have \"typed it with your own hands\". In case of difficulty, please reach out to the instructor as early as possible.\n\nYou should always save a copy of your submitted work, including lab and homework assignments. Store the copy in a secure location (such as your Google Drive).\n\n#### Generative AI Policy\n\nGenerative AI (Gen AI) tools, such as ChatGPT and Copilot, can be valuable resources for enhancing your learning experience.  However, their use must align with the following guidelines to maintain academic integrity and ensure meaningful learning:\n\nYou are encouraged to use Gen AI for **non-quiz assignments**, including **homework assignments, lab problems, and knowledge check questions**.You may use generative AI to explore ideas, clarify concepts, get hints, and receive help on specific tasks.\n\nThe use of Gen AI is **strictly forbidden during quizzes**. Using Gen AI during quizzes is considered a breach of academic integrity and may result in grading penalty and disciplinary actions.\n\nWe expect you to use Gen AI responsibly, including\n\n* Always **verify and refine** the generated content to ensure its accuracy and alignment with the course.\n* You should **take time to understand generative AI output** and be ready to explain it in your own words.\n* You should **incorporate your own ideas and perspectives** instead of relying entirely on generative AI.\n\n### Student Rating of Teaching (SRT) Evaluation\n\nThe Student Rating of Teaching (SRT) evaluation will be online.\n\nIt is important that every student should complete the SRT evaluation and provide feedback to the instructor. You evaluation and feedback are always appreciated by the instructor.\n\n### Tennessen Warning Notice Pursuant to MN Department of Administration’s Data Practices\n\nTo make this class more accessible to all enrolled students, we intend to record all class lectures and discussions.  Since your audio/video may be part of those recordings we are informing you.  Along with the instructor and teaching assistants, these recordings will be shared with only the students enrolled in the class during this semester, in accordance with FERPA regulations.\n\n### Carlson & University Policies\n\n#### Student Academic Misconduct and Scholastic Dishonesty\n\nThe Carlson School defines academic misconduct as any act by a student that misrepresents the student's own academic work or that compromises the academic work of another. Scholastic misconduct includes (but is not limited to) cheating on assignments or examinations, plagiarizing, i.e., misrepresenting as one's own work any work done by another, submitting the same paper, or substantially similar papers, to meet the requirement of more than one course without the approval and consent of the instructors concerned, or sabotaging another's work. Within this general definition, however, instructors determine what constitutes academic misconduct in the courses they teach. Students found guilty of academic misconduct face penalties ranging from lowering of the course grade or awarding a grade of F or N for the entire course, to suspension from the University.\n\nReview the [Student Conduct Code](https://z.umn.edu/policy-carlson_student_conduct_code) and [Student Conduct and Academic Integrity website](https://z.umn.edu/student_conduct_academic_integrity).\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about how to cite sources and avoid plagiarism, U of M libraries offers online [tutorials and tools related to citations](https://z.umn.edu/research_citation_tools).

Lucy's Play School\n\nLucy's Playschool is a child day care center. The play school keeps track of each child's contact person, anergies, and rooms they are assigned to, and employees who work in these rooms.\n\n* For each child, it tracks information including name, age, gender, birthday, and allergies. You may treat allergies as a single atomic field.\n* Each child must have an adult contact person. It saves information including the contact person's contact phone number, and address (including street, city, state, and zip code). Each child has one adult as his/her contact person but an adult can be a contact person for multiple children (e.g. one family may enroll multiple kids in the center).\n* The center has several rooms of different sizes. Each room has a room number, a designated capacity, and an assigned age group (infant, toddler, kid, pre-teen). For example, rooms 2 and 3 are for infants and room 4 is for toddlers.\n* A child is assigned to a room based on his/her age and availability of space. Each child is assigned to one room. Each room may be assigned to multiple children. But the room may also be vacant (when the enrollment is low).\n* A room may be managed by one or more employees. An employee can manage at most one room. Some employees do not manage any room (e.g. the reception desk employee).\n* The center keeps track of each employee's name, phone number, education, and gender\n\nBased on the above description, Develop an ER Diagram for Lucy's Play School using MySQL workbench.\n\n* You may ignore the data types for now.\n* If you make any assumptions, please state them explicitly.\n\n### 9.

{"id": "MABA6321-2026-SP__canvas_544815::md/assignments/5072482__Lab 4 - ER Diagram.md", "text": "# MABA 6321 Lab 4: Modeling Data with ER Diagrams\n\nIn this lab, we will practice creating ER diagram using MySQL Workbench, as well as identifying entities, attributes, and relationships based on the given business description.\n\n### 1. Consulting contracts\n\nCreate an ER diagram using **MySQL Workbench** based on the following description.\n\n* The `consulting contracts` database has three entities: `consultants`, `companies`, and `contracts`.\n* `Consultants` has three attributes: `consultant_id`, `consultant_name`, and `specialties`, where `consultant_id` is its primary key (PK).\n* `Companies` has three attributes also: `company_id`, `company_name`, and `industry_type`, where the first one is the PK.\n* `Contracts` has six attributes:`contract_id`, `company_id`, `consultant_id`, `contract_date`, `hourly_rate`, and `hours`, where the first one is the PK, and the second and third are PKs.\n\nYou may assume that all relationships are mandatory on both sides.\n\n### 2. Sports Goods\n\nThe Sports Goods sales system maintains detailed records of employees, customers, orders, and products.\n\n* For each customer, it maintains information such as name, address, city, state, zip code, and phone number. Each customer is uniquely identified by a CustomerID.\n* Each order is uniquely identified by an OrderNo and includes the order date and total amount. Every order is associated with exactly one customer and one employee, indicating who placed the order and who handled it. The employees involved in the sales process are identified by an EmployeeID and have attributes such as first name, last name, and job title.\n* Each order may include multiple products. For each product in an order, the system captures the quantity and purchase price. Each product is identified by a ProdID and includes descriptive attributes such as product name, group (or category), wholesale and retail prices, and the number of units currently on hand.\n\nCreate an ER diagram using **MySQL Workbench** based on the above business requirements. If you identify a many-to-many relationship, please convert it to a one-to-many relationships with an associative entity.\n\n### 3. **Fraud Detection**\n\nYou are tasked with designing the database for a digital financial services platform that provides online payment and transaction services to a growing user base. The platform allows users to register accounts, log in from different devices, make financial transactions, and make payments using various methods. A critical business requirement is the ability to monitor user activity for fraud detection and generate appropriate reports for high-risk transactions.\n\nEach user on the platform has a unique identifier and associated metadata, such as the date the account was created, the most recent login date, the current account status, and a cumulative count of past transactions. The platform supports device-based logins, meaning that users may interact with the platform using one or more devices, each uniquely identified by a device ID and specified by device type and MAC address.\n\nAll transactions are tracked with detailed logs that include the user involved, the transaction amount, the type of transaction (e.g., deposit, withdrawal, purchase), the date, and the device and IP address from which it was made. Additional metadata such as geolocation and number of login attempts at the time of the transaction are also captured. This data is crucial for behavioral analysis and anomaly detection.\n\nTo mitigate financial risks, the system includes a fraud detection component. When a suspicious transaction is identified, it is logged in a fraud report, which records the type of fraud, a risk score, and the current resolution status. Each fraud report is linked to both the transaction in question and the user associated with it. This allows the platform to analyze fraudulent behavior across different users and transactions for audit or enforcement actions.\n\nFinally, the platform tracks payments made by users. A user may have multiple payment records, each specifying the payment amount, payment method (e.g., credit card, PayPal), the last four digits of a payment card, and the payment status (e.g., successful, failed, pending). These records are used to manage and reconcile financial flows, support refunds, and maintain compliance with industry standards for transaction processing.\n\nCreate an ER diagram using **MySQL Workbench** based on the above business requirements. If you identify a many-to-many relationship, please convert it to a one-to-many relationships with an associative entity.\n\n---\n\n#### Submission guidelines\n\n* submit the PDFs for ER diagrams, one for each ERD.\n", "metadata": {"course_folder": "MABA6321-2026-SP__canvas_544815", "course_id": "MABA6321", "doc_type": "assignment", "title": "Lab 4 - ER Diagram", "source_url": "https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/544815/assignments/5072482", "canvas_course_id": 544815, "canvas_assignment_id": 5072482, "page_url": null, "updated_at": "2026-01-30T19:45:15Z", "due_at": "2026-02-16T05:59:00Z", "linked_from_module": true, "module_name": "Module 4: Data Modeling with ER Diagrams", "canvas_module_id": 2606749, "module_item_type": "Assignment", "module_item_id": 15828198, "module_item_position": 5, "module_item_published": null, "exported_html": "html/assignments/5072482__Lab 4 - ER Diagram.html", "converted_md": "md/assignments/5072482__Lab 4 - ER Diagram.md"}}

Originally, all the information is stored in one table, which leads to data redundancy and update anomalies. The initial table looks like this:\n\n* **EmployeeTraining** (emp\\_id, name, dept, salary, training\\_course\\_id, training\\_date)\n\n### 2. Online Retails Sales\n\nImagine you’re working with an e-commerce dataset that tracks sales transactions. The initial design is a single large table with order details, customer information, and product data, which leads to redundancy and potential data anomalies.\n\n* **SalesData** (order\\_id, order\\_date, customer\\_id, customer\\_name, email, shipping\\_address, product\\_id, product\\_name, unit\\_price, quantity)\n\n## Part 2. MySQL Database creation\n\n### 3. Create a `SportsGoods` database\n\n`sportsgood.mdb` is the MySQL workbench EER diagram we have created in the previous week. In this lab problem, we are going to create a database based on the EER model. We will then use generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT) to generate sample data and populate the database. Finally we will verify our database by creating a multi-table query.\n\n* `sportsgood.mwb` was created with out much regard to the field data type. We now want to make these improvements before creating the database.\n\n  + All the financial fields should use a `decimal(10,2)` data type.\n  + Some fields should be integeter type (e.g. zip code, prodID, Onhands)\n  + Data/Datetime fields should have `date` and `datetime` data types, respectively.\n  + The database (schema) should be called `sportsgoods` instead of the default `mydb` (you can change it on the left panel, **Catalog Tree**).\n  + Add a comment to the `onHand` field \"Number of units on hand\" (later on, this provide a hint to ChatGPT what this field is about; other fields are self-explanatory)\n* Using **File**> **Export**> **Foreward Engeer SQL create script** to create and save an SQL script for table and database creation. Note that in the last step, you can use **save to Other file** to save the generated script to `sportsgoods.sql`.\n* Execute `sportsgoods.sql` in MySQL workbench to create the database and tables.\n* Using **GenAI** (e.g. **Copilot** or **ChatGPT**, free version is fine) to generate the insert data scripts. One prompt could be:\n\n  + *I am going to provide a MySQL database creation script. Can you generate corresponding sample data for each table in the form of insert into SQL statements. Make sure the referential integration of the database is respected.*\n  + Then, you can paste the sportsgoods.sql into the chatbot, when prompted.\n  + Copy the resulting SQL insert scripts to a SQL file, and execute it to populated the database.\n* Test your database with a multi-table query that select all tables and fields (with appropriate join conditions).\n\n  + **Tip**: watch out for duplicate column names.\n\n---\n\n**Submission guidelines**:\n\n* For the first two questions.\n\n  + Type out the appropriate steps and resultant tables in each step, making sure the primary key for each table is properly identified.\n* For the 3rd question,\n\n  + paste the **dataqbase table creation** script,\n  + the **insert into** scripts,\n  + and the **query script and results**.\n", "metadata": {"course_folder": "MABA6321-2026-SP__canvas_544815", "course_id": "MABA6321", "doc_type": "assignment", "title": "Lab 5 - Normalization and DB design", "source_url": "https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/544815/assignments/5072483", "canvas_course_id": 544815, "canvas_assignment_id": 5072483, "page_url": null, "updated_at": "2026-01-30T19:40:32Z", "due_at": "2026-02-23T05:59:00Z", "linked_from_module": true, "module_name": "Module 5: Database Normalization & Design", "canvas_module_id": 2606750, "module_item_type": "Assignment", "module_item_id": 15828204, "module_item_position": 4, "module_item_published": null, "exported_html": "html/assignments/5072483__Lab 5 - Normalization and DB design.html", "converted_md": "md/assignments/5072483__Lab 5 - Normalization and DB design.md"}}

{"id": "MABA6321-2026-SP__canvas_544815::md/pages/SmartPAL User Guide.md", "text": "## Overview of The SmartPAL Project\n\nThe **SmartPAL project** is an instructional initiative led by Professor De Liu, aimed at promoting self-regulated learning through a combination of chatbots and gamification. SmartPAL leverages generative AI and Canvas integration to give you personalized, context-aware responses and proactive personalized support. The project also empowers instructors by providing data-driven insights and tools to better support students.\n\n## Eligibility\n\nSmartPAL currently works with selected Canvas courses, whose instructors have consented to enable SmartPAL for their courses. Every student in such participating courses can leverage SmartPAL as they progress through the course.\n\n## SmartPAL App Activation\n\nSmartPAL offers both a mobile app and a web app, accessible through a web browser. The web app does not require installation. We encourage you to install the mobile app because you can access it without using a PC.\n\n### SmartPAL Mobile App Installation\n\nSearch 'SmartPAL' in the iOS App Store or Google Play Store and look for the owl icon wearing an academic cap to install the app.\n\nIf you have downloaded the app in a prior semester, please **check for any available update**, as older version of the App may not work well with newly enrolled courses.\n\n### Sign In\n\nSign in with your **University email** or **SSO (Single Sign ON)** credentials. If using your email, create a user account the first time you log in.\n\nAfter signing in, the app will display a list of participating courses you're enrolled in for the current semester. If no courses appear, it may be because (a) you're not enrolled in any participating course, or (b) your enrollment hasn't been synced with SmartPAL. If the issue persists, please contact SmartPAL support at **smartpal@umn.edu**.\n\nOn the mobile app, it will also ask you to enable *push notification*. We encourage you to **enable push notification** so that you will always keep updated.\n\n## Earn Extra Credits\n\nParticipation in SmartPAL is voluntary. We offer 10.0 points (1.0%) as extra credit for participating in SmartPAL as an instructional tool.\n\nSmartPAL participation accounts for 10.0 points (1.0%) extra credit. To secure the extra credit, please complete the following tasks:\n\n* **SmartPAL Post Survey** (0 points): Complete a post survey near the *end of the course*. The link to the survey is available through the `SmartPAL Post Survey` assignment.\n* **SmartPAL App Activation** (0.0 points): Install/Activate the SmartPAL app at the beginning of the course. The instruction is given via the `SmartPAL App Activation` assignment.\n* **SmartPAL Learning Engagement** (5.0 points): Earn **42 learning engagement gems** by the end of the course to receive the full credit on this assignment. See `SmartPAL Learning Engagement` assignment for more details.\n* **SmartPAL Reflections** (5.0 points): Complete **5 reflections** by the end of the course to receive the full credit on this assignment. See the `SmartPAL Reflections` assignment for more details.\n\n## Why should you participate in the SmartPAL project?\n\n* SmartPAL will help you stay on top of your course and realize your full learning potential.\n* You'll gain first-hand experience with innovative AI learning assistant technologies through SmartPAL.\n* Your insights and feedback help improve SmartPAL as an instructional tool, enhancing the learning experience for you and future students.\n\n## Earning Gems for Learning Engagement\n\nThe app uses gems as a fun way to track your engagement in the course. You can collect gems from four types of engagement activities:\n\n* **Canvas Pageviews**: Each week, you can earn gems for being an active user of Canvas. A *pageview* means each time you click a Canvas link (such as an assignment, announcement, module, quiz). We track the number of pageviews you generate in the course and award gems based on the following rubric.:\n  + 1 to 10 pageviews, you will receive 1 gem\n  + 10 to 100 pageviews, you will receive 2 gems\n  + 100+ page views, you will receive 3 gems\n* **On-time Assignment Submissions**: You can earn gems each week by submitting assignments on time. For eligible assignments with due dates, gems are awarded based on the following rubric:\n  + missed all assignments, you earn 0 gems.\n  + Submitted at least one assignment (late or on time), 1 gem\n  + Submitted an assignment on time, 2 gems.\n  + Submitted all assignments on time, 3 gems.\n  + No assignments that week, you automatically earn 3 gems.\n* **Learning Reflections**: SmartPAL asks you to reflect on your learning every week.\n  + Completing this week's reflection earns you 2 gems.\n* **SmartPAL Engagement**: SmartPAL Engagement reflects how often you interact with the SmartPAL app. Each week, we measure engagement by counting the number of days you use the app. Based on this, you'll earn gems according to the following rubric.:\n  + Using SmartPAL (mobile or web) on 1 day during the week earns you 1 gem.\n  + Using SmartPAL (mobile or web) on 2 days during the week earns you 2 gems.\n  + Using SmartPAL (mobile or web) on 3+ days during the week earns you 3 gems.\n\n## Using Weekly Reflections to Enhance Your Learning and Instruction\n\nEach week, SmartPAL will ask you to complete a quick reflection on your learning—what worked well and what was challenging. It only takes a few minutes and helps both you and your instructor improve your learning experience. You can earn gems by completing learning reflections as part of your SmartPAL Learning Engagement.\n\nComplete your weekly reflections on the Mobile or Web App.\n\n## Level Up\n\nEarning gems helps you level up—your level rises after you've accumulated enough gems. We use the following rules to determine your level:\n\n* Level 1 (Noob): 0-17 gems\n* Level 2 (Pro): 18-47 gems\n* Level 3 (Epic): >= 48 gems\n\n## Leaderboard\n\nWe publish two leaderboards to celebrate the most engaged students in the course:\n\n* **Weekly leaderboard**: based on the number of gems earned in the current week (starting from Sunday)\n* **All-time leaderboard**: based on the total number of gems earned since the beginning of the course.\n\nThe leaderboard size is fixed at 5. If there is a tie (two or more students with the same number of gems), we include the one who has the most Canvas pageviews.\n\n## How to use the SmartPAL Chatbot?\n\nThe built-in Chatbot uses generative AI to understand and answer questions. The chatbot can currently answer the following types of questions:\n\n* Syllabus questions: e.g., what is the late policy?\n* Logistics and planning questions: e.g., What is covered in quiz 2? What is planned for this week? What are latest announcements?\n* Assignment questions: e.g. when is test X? what is my grade for the group project?\n* Grading related questions: e.g. What is my grade for test X? what is my grade for the group project?\n* SmartPAL related questions: e.g., How do I get engagement score on this app? How do I get more gems?\n* Questions related to the course topics: Can you explain the concept of \\_\\_\\_?\n\nAs this is a prototype chatbot, some responses may be incomplete or inaccurate. We appreciate your patience and understanding as it develops.\n\n## How do I get help or report a problem?\n\nYou may report SmartPAL problems or ask questions by emailing **smartpal@umn.edu**. We will get back to you as soon as possible, usually within 24 hours.\n", "metadata": {"course_folder": "MABA6321-2026-SP__canvas_544815", "course_id": "MABA6321", "doc_type": "page", "title": "SmartPAL User Guide", "source_url": "https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/544815/pages/smartpal-user-guide-3", "canvas_course_id": 544815, "canvas_assignment_id": null, "page_url": "smartpal-user-guide-3", "updated_at": "2026-01-30T19:41:28Z", "due_at": null, "linked_from_module": true, "module_name": "SmartPAL Learning Tools", "canvas_module_id": 2659675, "module_item_type": "Page", "module_item_id": 16202103, "module_item_position": 1, "module_item_published": null, "exported_html": "html/pages/SmartPAL User Guide.html", "converted_md": "md/pages/SmartPAL User Guide.md"}}

You will learn how to write **summary queries** using aggregate functions such as `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, and `MAX` to extract insights from datasets. We will also explore a variety of **SQL functions** that help you manipulate and analyze **numeric**, **textual**, and **datetime** values effectively. Additionally, this module will introduce the concept of **joining multiple tables** to answer more complex questions that require data from different sources. You’ll work with **inner joins**, **outer joins**, and understand how to combine data from related tables based on key relationships.\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\n* Write summary queries using aggregation functions and GROUP BY\n* Create computed columns using SQL functions and expressions\n* Query multiple tables using inner, outer joins, and union\n\n### To-Do This Module\n\n* Watch lecture videos\n* Complete **knowledge checks** associated with each video (if available)\n* Complete the **lab 2** for the module - you can do a problem set after each lecture video.\n* Complete the **homework 1**.\n\nModule Details (built in browser, hidden in app)\n", "metadata": {"course_folder": "MABA6321-2026-SP__canvas_544815", "course_id": "MABA6321", "doc_type": "page", "title": "Module 2: Overview", "source_url": "https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/544815/pages/module-2-overview", "canvas_course_id": 544815, "canvas_assignment_id": null, "page_url": "module-2-overview", "updated_at": "2025-12-24T16:41:44Z", "due_at": null, "linked_from_module": true, "module_name": "Module 2: Intermediate SQL", "canvas_module_id": 2606747, "module_item_type": "Page", "module_item_id": 15828179, "module_item_position": 1, "module_item_published": null, "exported_html": "html/pages/Module 2 Overview.html", "converted_md": "md/pages/Module 2 Overview.md"}}

Explain the following concepts in one or two sentences.\n\n* **DBMS**: refers to a general-purpose software system that facilitates the processes of defining, creating, using and maintaining databases\n* **Primary Key**: A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each row in that table.\n* **Foreign Key**: is a field (or a set of fields) in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It creates a relationship between two tables and enforces referential integrity.\n* **DML**: are SQL commands that maintain and query a database\n* **DDL**: are SQL commands that define a database, including creating, altering, and dropping tables and establishing constraints\n* **Outer JOIN**: is a type of SQL join that returns matched rows from two tables along with the unmatched rows from one or both tables, filling in missing values with NULLs.\n\n## Part 2: Hands On\n\n```\n-- ### 1. Find users from \"New York\", ordering results by `creationDate` and display only their id, display name, and location. Note that you should include cases such as \"New York ...\", \"...

Continuing with the previous query, find out the count of each Post Type, ordering results from the highest to the lowest count. The column header for count must be \"count\" and the column header for `PostTypeID` should be \"Post Type ID\".\n\n-- > Hint: `count` is a reserved word in SQL.\n\nSELECT PostTypeId as `Post Type ID`,\n    COUNT(*) AS `count` FROM posts\nGROUP BY PostTypeId\nORDER BY `count` desc;\n\n-- 4 row(s) returned\n\n-- # Post Type ID, count\n-- 2, 1585\n-- 1, 947\n-- 5, 168\n-- 4, 168\n\n-- ### 4.

Learn more about the [Carlson Course Grading Policy](https://z.umn.edu/policy-carlson_graduate_grading).\n\n### Carlson & University Policies\n\n#### Student Academic Misconduct and Scholastic Dishonesty\n\nThe Carlson School defines academic misconduct as any act by a student that misrepresents the student's own academic work or that compromises the academic work of another. Scholastic misconduct includes (but is not limited to) cheating on assignments or examinations, plagiarizing, i.e., misrepresenting as one's own work any work done by another, submitting the same paper, or substantially similar papers, to meet the requirement of more than one course without the approval and consent of the instructors concerned, or sabotaging another's work. Within this general definition, however, instructors determine what constitutes academic misconduct in the courses they teach. Students found guilty of academic misconduct face penalties ranging from lowering of the course grade or awarding a grade of F or N for the entire course, to suspension from the University.\n\nReview the [Student Conduct Code](https://z.umn.edu/policy-carlson_student_conduct_code) and [Student Conduct and Academic Integrity website](https://z.umn.edu/student_conduct_academic_integrity).\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about how to cite sources and avoid plagiarism, U of M libraries offers online [tutorials and tools related to citations](https://z.umn.edu/research_citation_tools). You can also visit the [Center for Writing](https://z.umn.edu/center_for_writing) for additional assistance.\n\n#### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities\n\nThe University of Minnesota is committed to providing all students equal access to learning opportunities. \nThe Disability Resource Center (DRC) is the campus office that works with students who have disabilities to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations. Students registered with the DRC, who have a letter requesting accommodations, are encouraged to contact the instructor early in the semester. Students who have, or think they may have, a disability (e.g. psychiatric, attention, learning, vision, hearing, physical, or systemic), are invited to contact the DRC for a confidential discussion at 612-626-1333 (V/TTY) or at [drc@umn.edu](mailto:drc@umn.edu). Additional information is available on the [Disability Resource Center website](https://z.umn.edu/disability_resource_center).\n\n#### Title IX\n\n[Title IX](https://z.umn.edu/title_ix_process) prohibits sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and relationship violence, in education.\n\n#### Students with Mental Health and Stress Management\n\nAs a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student's ability to participate in daily activities. University of Minnesota services are available to assist you with addressing these and other concerns you may be experiencing. Learn more about the broad range of confidential [mental health services](https://z.umn.edu/mental_health_services) available on campus.\n\n#### Student Writing Support\n\nAs a student, you may experience challenges in your writing. The University of Minnesota has a [student writing support resource](https://z.umn.edu/student_writing_support) to help with your writing.\n\n#### Additional University Policies\n\n1.

{"id": "MGMT6305-2026-SP__canvas_545013::md/syllabus.md", "text": "Syllabus\n\n# Syllabus\n\n## MGMT 6305 The International Environment of Business\n\n### INTRODUCTION\n\nWelcome to the International Environment of Business (“IEB”) course. Let me give you an overview of the IEB course.  It is about the external challenges confronting managers and firms competing internationally.  The activities of many firms have an international element –think, for example, of a local Minneapolis restaurant that imports some of the ingredients used in its menu offerings.  But the paradigmatic firms of interest in this course are large established multinational corporations (“MNEs”) and smaller ones just starting to internationalize their operations.  Both compete internationally and both need to manage international legal, political, and social dynamics affecting survival and success.\n\nMNEs often do that differently. An MNE typically owns or controls significant resources and operations in several, often disparate countries, cultures and markets.  MNE performance depends on internal and external income streams denominated in multiple currencies.  The MNE has operations situated in localities with different and often conflicting legal, political, and social policy priorities.  On top of these complexities, the MNE is characteristically engaged in a “two-tiered” conflict with rival firms.  The first tier involves conflicts in a host country involving the MNE and another MNE –think of, say, Minnesota-based Medtronic competing with another medical technology producer like Boston Scientific.  A second tier involves conflicts between the MNE and purely domestic producers in a host country –think here of, say, Medtronic operating in Germany and competing with the medical technology business under the corporate umbrella of Munich-based Siemens AG.  Resolution of conflict on both tiers depends heavily on legal, political, and social factors in home and host countries as well as in institutional “spaces” linking the two.\n\nSmaller MNEs compete and manage many of the same legal, political, and social factors differently.  They lack international resources and operations.  Indeed, that may be the reason smaller MNEs go abroad.  More often, they are following customers demanding an international presence as a condition for continued patronage at home.  When they go abroad, they often do so in steps analogous to swimming.  They “toe” the waters that are foreign markets by selling goods through international trade with some foreign counterpart. They “wade into the waters by setting up a foreign distributorship or by licensing some technology abroad, or by franchising their business processes to a foreign franchisee.  With time and some success, they might then “swim” in ways similar to large established MNEs.  They establish their own foreign subsidiary with its own plant, property, and equipment.  Now that smaller MNE is larger with competing at home and abroad and managing the same panoply of environmental factors.\n\nThese competitive and environmental factors make MNEs so interesting to study.  They enter and exit foreign markets, compete with and coopt rival firms and host-country governments. The IEB course is about understanding this international theater, *as you like* *it*, and how MNEs act in it effectively.\n\n### IEB COURSE THEMES AND AIMS\n\nSo the overall theme of the IEB course is understanding MNEs and different types of external factors shaping their behavior and performance.  We’ll answer these questions:  Why do firms go abroad?  Why do they do so as MNEs?  How are MNEs typically structured?  How do they compete with other foreign and domestic firms?  What legal, political, and social factors shape MNE behavior and performance generally?  How do great MNEs manage those factors, perhaps even turn them into advantages? We’ll address that overall theme and answer those questions through close analysis of case studies and readings (reading), classroom discussion (saying), and opportunities to participate in simulated negotiations relevant to the activities of MNEs, to the host countries where they operate, and to local firms and other individuals often collaborating with MNEs (doing).\n\nYou should be reading materials, discussing them, and role-playing people in those materials to give these broad course themes concrete relevance and help you get the most from the IEB course.  By the end of the semester, your reading, saying, and doing should make plain to you certain heuristics useful in diagnosing environmental issues facing MNEs, useful in addressing those issues as a thoughtful international manager, lawyer, political consultant, and social commentator would.  In sum, completing this course should help become a corporate “diplomat” ready to lead an international firm’s daily operations and deal with strategic issues and decisions as they occasionally arise.\n\n### IEB COURSE APPROACH\n\n#### IEB As Craft and First Language\n\nIn working through the IEB course and in answering the questions above, it will be helpful to think of certain analogies.  Take, for instance, the analogy of IEB as a craft rather than as a science.  There are few, if any, universal rules to govern the actions of MNEs managing legal, political, and social environmental factors.  IEB study is, thus, not like the study of a physical science such as chemistry, physics or geology.  IEB is more akin to a craft such as weaving, painting or jewelry-making.  The “right” thing to do in a particular business setting may have limited applicability to other situations.  IEB is a study of contingencies.  This course is designed to give you a mode of thinking about such contingencies.\n\nIt may also be helpful to think of learning IEB as you think of learning your first language (but not your second language).  A second language is often learned by formal methods.  Aspirants study the grammar, vocabulary, and syntax of a second language through coursework or tutoring sessions.  Learning the first language is much less formal.  It is learned at home, at work, at play.  It is often the product of observation, mimicry, trial-and-error.  To a large extent, that is how students acquaint themselves with aspects of IEB.\n\nBecause it is akin to a craft and because it is best learned by “doing,” there is little substitute for experiences involving conflict between MNEs and other firms, between those international firms and quasi-firm organizations, and between those international firms and home or host governments.  Hence, this course uses case analysis as the primary teaching tool.  Our cases are drawn from varied industrial contexts including aircraft manufacturers and airlines, consumer electronics, mining, and automobiles, as well as welding, waste disposal, metal engraving, coffee.  They come from varied country contexts such as the US, Western Europe and Japan, but also from developing countries in Latin America, the Middle East, and Sub-Saharan Africa.  They are larger MNEs competing globally and smaller ones doing foreign jobs here and there as they present themselves.  The MNEs we study will come from varied time periods running from the late 1960s to the 2020s.  With such variation, students will have a broad range of case experience for developing skills for evaluating different dimensions of the IEB that are realistic and founded on the specific characteristics of the situation at hand.\n\n#### Six IEB Course Modules\n\nThe course is divided into six modules.  Each module includes cases raising related issues.  The first module (Sessions 1-6) introduces the IEB course and includes cases covering foundational issues in any IEB study:  Why do firms go abroad?  Why do they go as MNEs?  What organizational structures, norms of practice, ways of seeing the world affect MNE structure, strategy, and performance?  What’s special about how international firms compete in “global” industries.\n\nThe second module of the course (Sessions 7-10) begins our survey of environmental factors shaping MNE structure, strategy, and performance.  We start with legal factors in the international environment.  We analyze legal cases touching international contracting and dispute resolution issues, including disputes with host-country governments.  The issues are important to both large, established MNEs and smaller ones going abroad in those stages we noted earlier.  Maybe these issues are more important for smaller MNEs because they are less likely to have ready access to legal professionals to help them avoid or deal adroitly with the international legal environment when it becomes inclement.  In an internationalizing SME, you may be your own lawyer.  And here you cannot afford to have a fool for a client.\n\nThe third module (Sessions 11-14) shifts from legal to political issues shaping MNE strategy.  The quintessential political risk is expropriation of firm assets by an opportunistic host country government.  Here we’ll learn how this “obsolescing bargain” with MNEs is formed, breached, and then reformed.  We’ll learn how to anticipate and, perhaps, deter expropriation through a combination of products and services that can be bought and internal self-help. One strategy is to sue the host-country government as discussed in Module 2.  Another way is to make the host-country government a co-investor motivating the government to help rather than hinder foreign investing MNEs.  If taking that “political” rather than “legal” approach, then there are some “minority rules” to learn in advance.  In Module 3, you’ll learn them. You’ll also learn about some of the “latest” political risks tied to the populist inclination of many host-country governments in Europe. The politics and political risks of growing populism pose new threats building on old ideas. We’ll show how. And we’ll learn more about how MNEs manage risks associated with what Carl von Clausewitz called the “politics by other means” –war.\n\nThe fourth module (Sessions 15-19) shifts our attention from polities to societies and the norms that guide business behavior.  We’ll study how MNEs from North America and Western Europe manage social norms that permit, even encourage unsafe working conditions, child labor, bribery, discrimination, and other business practices in developing countries. And in these exceptional times, who can resist analysis of the international business implications of giving so much power over international trade policy to one man living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in DC and Mar-a-Lago in Florida? Module 4 will also give us an opportunity to think about current social issues giving individuals the chance to fund, found, and grow international businesses with a handful of cash remittable to family back home.  The biggest foreign capital inflow into most developing countries today is no longer foreign direct investment from MNEs or foreign portfolio flows from venture capitalists, or foreign aid from wealthy governments and international organizations.  It is remittances from migrants.  We’ll learn how remittances are re-shaping the developing world and providing all sorts of international business opportunities for us to exploit.\n\nThe fifth module (Sessions 20-24) gives us an opportunity to put it all together.  We’ll devote a complete evening to simulating an opportunity to invest in up to three countries in Southeast Asia.  You’ll play the role of an MNE considering a multi-million dollar foreign direct investment project in Malaysia, Singapore, or Indonesia.  Or maybe you’ll play the role of a local Malaysian, Singaporean, or Indonesian firm interested in partnering with an MNE.  Or maybe you’ll play the role of the Malaysian, Singaporean, or Indonesian government seeking an MNE’s investment as long as it doesn’t cost too much to attract them and as long as the MNE’s investment also serves the country’s broader development goals.  Each of you will have a chance to think about and act on legal, political, and social issues we discussed in the past several weeks.\n\nThe sixth and final module (Sessions 25-28) is devoted to you and your final presentations.  Over the semester, you and your group of 4-6 students will have been working on a real IEB problem facing a real MNE.  What is the problem?  How is the firm addressing it?  What connections do you draw from their problem and their strategy for addressing it to problems we’ve identified and strategies we’ve proposed to address them?  Those are the questions you’ll answer in our final two sessions where you and your group will have time to present and then to take questions from me and others in the IEB course.\n\n### IEB COURSE REQUIREMENTS\n\n#### IEB Class Participation\n\nThis course relies heavily on case materials.  Analysis and discussion of different international business contexts is the primary activity in class meetings.  Individual preparation and participation are, therefore, essential to the success of the class in examining all the relevant issues.  The readings are your responsibility, and they will not necessarily be discussed directly in class, except as they apply directly to a case problem at hand.\n\n#### IEB Case Preparation\n\nSince case analysis and discussion is so important to the course, it is worth proposing an approach to preparing them effectively.  Preparation for case discussion can begin with a rapid reading of the assigned text and case materials.  Then, it is worthwhile to review the assignment questions for clues as to what issues require special attention.  The next step is normally to re-read the case carefully, taking notes which sort information, facts, and observations under several relevant headings.  Most students will then want to perform some quantitative analyses, exploring various hypotheses as to the nature and importance of certain phenomena.  You may use the Discussion Questions as guides for choosing relevant analyses to perform.  In addition to the Discussion Questions consider these generic case questions/analyses:\n\nWhat is the problem facing the firm internally (intra-firm) or externally (inter-firm or firm vrs. another type of rival such as a host-country government or supplier)?\n\n(Problem Analysis)\n\nHow would you assess the firm’s past strategy and performance?\n\n(Past Firm/Environment Analysis)\n\nWhat is the firm’s current intent, i.e. what is the firm trying to accomplish in the near term?\n\n(Firm Intent Analysis)\n\nHow would you assess the firm’s competitive environment including:\n\nthe firm’s macro-economic environment (country or regional factors)?\n\nthe firm’s industrial environment?\n\nthe firm’s internal resources,

Grading\n\nGrades for this course are based on five performance components totaling 100 course points.  The five 25 components are:  1) answers to discussion questions for one class session; 2) write-up on foreign investment simulation; 3) final case study project group report and presentation; 4) attendance and active participation in class meetings; and 5) a take-home final exam.  Each of these course performance components are discussed below in greater detail. \n\n### 1.         Answers to discussion questions for one class session        (10 Points)\n\nFor each class session there are discussion questions for you to think about in preparing materials for a given day.  I want you to write up and submit answers to the discussion for one class session from Sessions 7-16.  I will assign you a class session to write up answers to discussion questions based on your last (family) name.  Your answers should be typed in 12-point font and should not exceed 1000 words in total.\n\n \n\n### 2.         Write-up after foreign investment simulation                         (10 Points)\n\nAfter completing the foreign investment simulation on April 3, I want you to write an essay answering three questions:  1) What happened to you during the simulation; 2) How do you defend your actual deal with other parties or proposed but not completed deal?  and 3) What did the simulation teach you about the international environment of business?  Your answers should be typed in 12-point font and should not exceed 1000 words in total.\n\n \n\n### 3.         Group case study report and presentation                            (30 Points)\n\nThe last four class sessions (Sessions 25-28) are devoted to group reports you will have written up and presented for feedback from me and other class members.  The report should be typed in 12-point font and should not exceed 4,000 words in total, exclusive of any references, tables, and figures.  It is due at the beginning of the class session when your group is presenting.  The group presentation should be made using power-point slides and should run from 20-30 minutes depending on the number of groups.  The group will then take questions from me and other class members for up to 10-20 minutes immediately after the presentation.  Power-point slides are to be submitted immediately after that same class session.  I will weigh the report and the presentation this way: 20 of the 30 total points available depend on the written report; 10 of the 30 total points available depend on the presentation and Q&A.\n\n### 4.         Attendance and activities participation in class sessions      (20 Points)\n\nClass participation constitutes a significant portion of the course grade.  It is important first because it provides me with the best and most frequent indication that you have prepared for class.  Second, it is important because your participation in class discussion teaches others.\n\n For both reasons you need to make every reasonable effort to be in class on time and well prepared.  If you are absent from class without telling me in advance, or unless you missed because of a medical or family emergency, your participation grade will suffer.  The point is to come to class, to be prepared, and to be active.\n\n In grading class participation, I will look at both the quantity and quality of your contributions.  With regard to quantity, the criteria are quite straightforward:\n\nI have never penalized someone for speaking up too often.  More has *almost always* been better.\n\nYou should, however, try to include others.  The best interventions respond to a fellow student’s point and start a dialogue not a monologue.\n\n \n\nWith regard to quality, some of the criteria normally applied include the following:\n\nWhether the points raised are relevant to the discussion.\n\nWhether the points raised go beyond a mere recitation of case facts, and actually draw out implications.\n\nWhether the points raised show evidence of analysis rather than mere expression of opinions.\n\nWhether the points raised build on points raised by others in the class.\n\nWhether the points raised contribute further to the class understanding of the issues under discussion.\n\n### 5.         Take-home final exam                                                            (30 Points)\n\nThere will be a take-home final exam distributed at the end of the last class session. The exam will be open book & open notes. I will provide more specific details later in the semester.\n\nWe will discuss these grading components in greater detail as the course unfolds.  Here is how final IEB course point totals correspond to final IEB course grades.\n\n### IEB Course Points                                  Final IEB Course Grade\n\n                        100 – 90                                                           A\n\n                        85 – 89                                                             A-\n\n                        80 – 84                                                             B+\n\n                        75 – 79                                                             B\n\n                        70 - 74                                                              B-\n\n                        65 – 69                                                             C+\n\n                        60 – 64                                                             C\n\n                        55 – 59                                                             C-\n\n                        < 55                                                                 Failed\n\n### IEB COURSE TEXTS, ADDITIONAL READINGS, LECTURE MATERIALS\n\nThere is no textbook for the IEB course.  All readings are listed below and will be made available to you via electronic links at our Canvas website or in a case and readings packet available via the usual means.  If you are looking for a text to “bone-up” on general management issues, I like Robert Grant’s *Contemporary Strategy Analysis* (Blackwell Publishers).  Any recent edition will due. It is available via Amazon.com or other online booksellers.  Anything else we need for this course will be supplied by me to you electronically.\n\n### **STUDENT MATTERS**\n\nThe Carlson School is part of the broader University community with additional policies that govern the conduct of students and instructors in any course. Below is a survey of University policies with summary information and links you can go to for more detail.  Please feel free to discuss these additional policies with me at any mutually convenient time.\n\nThe University seeks an environment that promotes academic achievement and integrity, that is protective of free inquiry, and that serves the educational mission of the University. Similarly, the University seeks a community that is free from violence, threats, and intimidation; that is respectful of the rights, opportunities, and welfare of students, faculty, staff, and guests of the University; and that does not threaten the physical or mental health or safety of members of the University community. For more information, see the Board of Regents Policies located here: https://regents.umn.edu/policy/all.\n\n \n\nYou are expected to do your own academic work and cite sources as necessary. Failing to do so is scholastic dishonesty. Scholastic dishonesty means plagiarizing; cheating on assignments or examinations; engaging in unauthorized collaboration on academic work; taking, acquiring, or using test materials without faculty permission; submitting false or incomplete records of academic achievement; acting alone or in cooperation with another to falsify records or to obtain dishonest grades, honors, awards, or professional endorsement; altering, forging, or misusing a University academic record; or fabricating or falsifying data, research procedures, or data analysis. If it is determined that a student has cheated, the student may be given an \"F\" or an \"N\" for the course, and may face additional sanctions from the University. For more information, see Board of Regents Policies located here: https://regents.umn.edu/policy/all.\n\n The University is committed to providing quality education to all students regardless of disability. Determining appropriate disability accommodations is a collaborative process. You as a student must register with Disability Services and provide documentation of your disability. The course instructor must provide information regarding a course's content, methods, and essential components. The combination of this information will be used by Disability Services to determine appropriate accommodations for a particular student in a particular course. For more information, see the Board of Regents Policies located here: https://regents.umn.edu/policy/all.\n\n As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, and feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance and may reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. University of Minnesota services are available to assist you. For more information, see the Board of Regents Policies located here: https://regents.umn.edu/policy/all.  \n\nStudents are responsible for knowing University policies on sexual harassment, discrimination, equity, diversity, and affirmative action. For information on those policies see the Board of Regents Policies located here: https://regents.umn.edu/policy/all.\n\n### **COURSE SCHEDULE OF SUBJECTS, READINGS AND ASSIGNMENTS**\n\nSession 1:                                Wednesday January 21, 2026, 5:45-7:15pm\n\nSUBJECT:                                Course Introduction:  The International Environment and Strategy\n\nREADINGS:                             **None**\n\nCASE DISCUSSION:                **None**\n\nSession 2:                               Wednesday, January 21, 2026, 7:35-9:05pm\n\nSUBJECT:                                Why Do Firms Internationalize?\n\nREADINGS:\n\nDunning, J. 1988. ***The Eclectic Paradigm of International Production: A Restatement and Some Possible Extensions***. *Journal of International Business Studies*, Spring Volume:  1-31.\n\nSiegel, J. & Collins, D. 2006.  ***Introduction to International Strategy: Module Note***.

Lincoln Electric is a Cleveland-based welding services firm that has already gone abroad as an MNE but is now considering India as  new international market.  Lincoln’s CEO is mulling over whether to invest in India, and if so, with what form of FDI.  You will help him with that decision.  First, we’ll ground it in a broader theoretical framework explaining when it makes sense for firms to go abroad as an MNE or SME.  It is the ownership-location-internalization (OLI) framework.  The OLI framework might also help in addressing the second question about how to enter.\n\n***Discussion Questions:***\n\n* Should Lincoln Electric enter India?\n* If so, should Lincoln Electric own a manufacturing operation there? If so, then should the company acquire a local player or build their own greenfield plant?\n* If a joint venture is preferred, then think about how Lincoln Electric will ensure its ability to make key business decisions in India.\n* John Dunning analyzes the decision to internationalize a firm’s operations as a function of that firm’s ownership, location and internalization (OLI) factors. How do you apply the OLI factors to Lincoln Electric and its decision about whether to enter India.\n\nTHE ESPRESSOR LANE TO GLOBAL MARKETS                                                             **(Session 3)**\n\nSynopsis: Founded in Trieste, Italy, Illy marketed a unique blend of coffee drinks in over 140 countries and in more than 50,000 of the world's best restaurants and coffeehouses. The company wanted to expand the reach of its own franchised coffee bar, *Espressamente*, through international expansion. Potential markets included Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, India, the United Kingdom and the United States. In addition to market selection, mode of entry was vital and included options such as exporting, franchising and joint venture. This case provides a practical example of the challenges faced in international business.  It also gives us an opportunity to understand alternative internationalization paths.  Do MNEs and SMEs follow economic or sociological considerations when taking that path?  Do they care more about a foreign country’s market size or cultural similarity?\n\n***Discussion Questions:***\n\n* Is espresso coffee retailing a global industry? What do you think is the most important factor behind Illy’s efforts to internationalize operations.?\n* And what about the pattern of internationalization? How does the path of foreign market entry and development confirm, disconfirm or perhaps render irrelevant Hofstede’s ideas about cultural distance and business practices across certain country groups?\n* Maybe Illy’s luck is running out. The last big national market for its product, the US is approaching maturity in the industry product life cycle is reaching maturity in other countries worth entering.  Defend or attack this assessment.  No fence-sitting allowed.\n\nPHILIPS V. MATSUSHITA:  THE COMPETITIVE BATTLE CONTINUES                         **(Session 4)**\n\nSynopsis:  This case contrasts the development of Philips' and Matsushita's international organizations and associated organizational capabilities. Philips, with fully developed national organizations abroad, struggles to coordinate its operations on a global scale, but encounters strong resistance to organizational and cultural changes. Grim financial results in early 1990s cast doubt on the company's previous 20 years of organizational and strategic change. Matsushita, the highly centralized industry leader, struggles to internationalize its organization by decentralizing assets, responsibilities, and decision making. Its attempts to build independent national organizations abroad are equally disappointing.  This case gives us an opportunity to raise issues relating internal strategy processes and structures to external global strategy content.  In short, how does MNE internal process and structure influence external conflict between the MNE and other firms?\n\n***Discussion Questions:***\n\n* How did Philips become the leading consumer electronics company in the world in the postwar era? What distinctive resources/abilities/competencies did Philips build?  What distinctive disadvantages?\n* How did Matsushita succeed in displacing Philips as No. 1? What were its distinctive resources/abilities/competencies?  And its distinctive disadvantages?\n* What do you think of the change each MNE has made to date -objectives, implementation, impact? Why is the change so hard for both of them?\n* What recommendations would you make to the Philips CEO? To the Matsushita CEO?\n\nAIRBUS V. BOEING CASE SERIES                                                                                     (**Session 5**)\n\n**Synopsis:**  Some industries –but only some- are inherently global in nature. They are given to one, two or only a few MNEs dominating the market.  Long-haul civil aircraft manufacturing may be one those industries.  If so, then it’s a “winner-take-all” or “winner-take-most” fight by the two MNEs seeking that domination: US-based Boeing and Europe-based Airbus.  Both have benefited from government support. Airbus was created as an entity owned by several European states. Boeing was always a privately-owned entity but received substantial US government revenue as a prime defense contractor.  Both MNEs think that support (and more) justified as they mull over whether and how to develop a new generation of superjumbo jet offerings for the travelling public.  Isn’t it “good” public policy for home-country governments to subsidize their national champion MNEs if that subsidy could help their MNE win the global market and shower the home country with all sorts of positive externalities:  more employment, technology, wealth, military power, independence and influence.  That’s the setting for our case where Boeing and Airbus (and their respective home-country governments) are mulling over whether to cooperate or compete in the production of superjumbo jets in the 1990s and 2000s, and then live with that decision in the 2010s.\n\n***Discussion Questions:***\n\n* What are the characteristics of a global industry?\n* Are there differences that matter between the subsidies that Airbus and Boeing receive? How do their respective home-country governments justify those subsidies?\n* What is “industrial policy” according to Krugman, Obstfeld and Melitz? How does their view of industrial policy differ with Michael Porter’s explanation of government’s role in fostering firm competitive advantages?\n* What is “strategic trade policy” and how does it matter in the Brander-Spence model of trade?\n* How do you explain the different decisions about whether to produce superjumbo jets at Airbus and Boeing?\n\nBRANDS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION v. REACH COMPANIES, LLC                    (**Session 7**)\n\n**Synopsis**:  We begin module 2 with an introduction to legal issues associated with a cross-border sales transactions. The *Brands* case provides us with an opportunity to see how such transactions are negotiated between merchants, and how state and national versus international legal regimes regarding sales contracts and their interpretation differ. Among other points, *Brands* highlights the importance of carefully writing draft agreements, especially when those drafts address choice of law for their interpretation when breached. In this case, a contract for delivery of hand sanitizer on behalf of Canada-based Brands by Minnesota-based Reach failed to expressly exclude application of a separate international legal regime summarized under the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). So the CISG rather than Minnesota law governed the contract. The big issue for the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit was about whether Brands could collect attorneys’ fees from Reach for Reach’s breach of contract. The Eighth Circuit’s 2024 opinion about whether Brands could recover those fees under the CISG reversed a 2023 decision by the lower US District Court for the District of Minnesota. At first glance, the 2024 decision seemed surprising. We’ll show why it wasn’t and what it means going forward for small, medium, and large MNEs doing business around the world.\n\n***Discussion Questions:***\n\n* Why does the CISG apply to the transaction in dispute between Brands and Reach (and how do you know)?\n* Assuming that Minnesota law governed the contract, do you think Brands would still have been able to recover attorneys’ fees from Reach?\n* What sources of law did the Eighth Circuit refer to in reversing the lower court and awarding Brands attorneys fees?\n* It’s pretty clear that the attorneys for both Brands and Reach –both large MNEs— didn’t understand how choice of law rules worked in an international transaction. What does that tell you about how law matters in international transaction negotiation and dispute resolution?\n\nMITSUBISHI V. SOLER CHRYSLER-PLYMOUTH                                                               (**Session 8**)\n\n**Synopsis**:  Litigation of cross-border sales and other transactions increasingly takes place in front of arbitral panels in boardrooms rather than judges and juries in courtrooms.  In this session we ask why.  Mitsubishi gives us a US perspective on this question.  And the AAA reading tells us how best to write agreements consistent with that US perspective.\n\n***Discussion Questions:***\n\n* What is the function of a dispute resolution clause?\n* What is arbitration compared to other non-judicial forms of dispute resolution?\n* Why do parties so often use arbitration in international transactions?\n* Mitsubishi seems to stand for the proposition that parties can contract away virtually all substantive rights to sue in US courts, including federal statutory rights. Is that an accurate reading of Mitsubishi?\n\nFINLEY RESOURCES AND OTHERS V. MEXICO                                                             (**Session 9**)\n\n**Synopsis**. How do MNEs sue a sovereign state? Up until the early 1960s the question was irrelevant. MNEs couldn’t. Then countries started signing international investment agreements (IIAs) including investor state dispute resolution terms permitting such suits under certain conditions. The *Finley* case helps us understand how such suits can go forward under two of the most important IIAs: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) enacted in the early 1990s under the Clinton administration; and the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) enacted in the late 2010s under the (first) Trump administration. The *Finley* cases applies both IIAs, so we can get a sense of how both differ in the rights and obligations they impose on MNEs trying to hold states to account. The Finley case is long. First, browse through it just to get a sense of how long and winding a road it is for MNEs like Finley to exploit IIAs, particularly the newer USMCA. Then try to acquaint yourselves with the facts of the alleged breach of contract by Mexico’s state-owned subsidiary of Pemex, PEP.  Finally, look at the conclusion of the decision by the ICSID tribunal ultimately awarding damages –money— to Finley. Was it all worth it for Finley?\n\n***Discussion Questions:***\n\n* Which dispute resolution mechanisms were more effective for Finley in its dispute with the Mexican government?\n* How do NAFTA-based dispute resolution terms differ with USMCA-based terms?\n* Look at the McMillans LLP publication analyzing different ways to sue states under the USMCA. A direct lawsuit by an MNE against a state isn’t the only way to try and hold a state accountable. What’s wrong with using those alternatives?\n* If, after studying the *Finley* case, you were advising other small- or medium-sized MNEs about how IIAs “protect” themselves in transactions with foreign states, what advice would you emphasize?\n\nTHE 3M CHINA BRIBERY CASE                                                                                      (**Session 10**)\n\n**Synopsis**. Issues of bribery and corruption often confront MNEs, particularly when dealing with host-country government officials, and particularly in developing countries. The US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is a US response to that issue with its origins in two notorious instances of bribery involving the sale of military planes to Japan and civil aircraft to Pakistan. Since then, the FCPA has undergone several revisions and other wealthier industrialized countries in Western Europe and the Pacific have enacted similar laws. The 2023 3M China bribery case is important to understand not just to see how the FCPA works in practice but to understand how easy it is to detect by MNE headquarters and then respond to effectively. It is pretty clear that 3M’s healthcare subsidiary operations in China were bribing Chinese health ministry officials for years before 3M’s headquarters in suburban St. Paul discovered it. After this case was settled, 3M “spun off” its healthcare division into a separate MNE. Reviewing this case in light of the subsequent spin off will help us understand how MNE organization and oversight capability matter for the control of bribery abroad.\n\n***Discussion Questions:***\n\n* Look at the summary description of the FCPA and the summary of 3M’s FCPA violation in two documents published online by the SEC. What were the elements of 3M’s FCPA violation?\n* At first glance, the fines and disgorgement 3M paid out to settle the FCPA violations seemed to be pretty small compared to the business advantages 3M likely gained over the years it bribed Chinese health officials with luxury trips to “educational” conferences. What other costs do you think 3M’s FCPA violations prompted?\n* In 2023, 3M’s healthcare division was one of many in a highly diversified MNE. The spin-off of the healthcare division into a separate company in 2024 meant that the new MNE would serve only one industry. How does that matter for future oversight of operations for future FCPA violations?\n\nCHAD-CAMEROON PETROL’M DEVELOPMENT & PIPELINE PROJECT (A-D)    **(Sessions 11-12)**\n\n**Synopsis:**  On June 6, 2000, the World Bank's and IFC's board of directors was scheduled to vote on whether to approve funding for the $4 billion Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline project. Although the project presented a unique opportunity to alleviate poverty in Chad, one of the poorest countries in the world, Chad had a president who had been labeled \"warlord\" and a history of civil war and oppression. This case describes the project, the setting, and the World Bank's reasons for participating in the deal--mainly an opportunity to alleviate poverty, enforce environmental standards, and minimize the impact on indigenous people. It also describes the very public and very ardent opposition to the project's environmental, social, and revenue management policies. Faced with a high-risk, but potentially high-return opportunity to improve conditions in Chad, students, we’ll discuss decide whether it is wise to approve funding for the deal.  This case illustrates not only the complexity of negotiating very large deals between public and private entities, but also the opportunity inherent in large-scale investment. We’ll assess whether the benefits received by the host countries are commensurate with the risks they bear. This discussion raises critical ethical issues related to investment in developing countries. With regard to project finance, the case illustrates the difference between project and corporate finance and shows that risk sharing and risk mitigation are motivations for using project finance.\n\n***Discussion Questions:***\n\n* What is political risk? How is it related to sovereign risk? (Session 11)\n* If you were going to buy political risk insurance in the late 1990s as terms of the Chad-Cameroon pipeline project are being negotiated, then what kind of coverage when (and how much) would you buy? (Session 11)\n* How do you justify the World Bank’s inclusion of Chad and Cameroon as partial equity owners in the two pipeline companies? Didn’t Ronald Reagan tell us that the nine most terrifying words in the English language are that “I’m from the government and I’m here to help.”? (Session 11)\n* What is project finance-based investment and why do you think it is used in the Chad Cameroon pipeline project? (Session 12)\n* Which part of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in the 1990s when the Chad Cameroon pipeline investment terms were first negotiated proved most helpful when those terms were being re-negotiated in the 20002? (Session 12)\n* After all of the risk-management innovations included in this project, it still ended up having all sorts of snafus. What does that teach you about managing political risks in less developed countries? Is it nothing more than re-arranging deck chairs on the Titanic? (Session 12)\n\nTORO EARNINGS CALL ON ACTIVITY IN UKRAINE AND RUSSIA, MARCH 2022     (**Session 13**)\n\n**Synopsis.** Four years ago, it would’ve seemed strange to devote a course session to how (US) firms do business in wartime. Then the world changes, we get over the shock, and business pundits tell us we should’ve seen it (and planned for it) all along. So there. This session begins with four anecdotes about four firms doing business in and with Russia and Ukraine immediately after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Each anecdote comes with a “lesson” for other firms that may face a similar situation in the near term. We’ll spend more time on one particular anecdote and lesson involving the Toro Corporation and its regional distributor in Russia and the Ukraine, Engo. I want you to read through the transcript of Toro’s quarterly earnings call with analysts from March 2022, only weeks after Russia’s invasion and Western countries aghast at Russia’s aggression imposed economic sanctions leading to business closures and exits throughout Russia. Opening comments from Toro’s CEO sought to anticipate and neutralize claims that the company was still doing business in Russia. Look closely at those comments and then the lack of any analyst follow-up questions about those comments. Then look at the Engo website and contemporary statements by Engo’s CEO Norbert Zatko (translated via Google from Russian to English). Something’s amiss. We’ll discuss that and see where it takes us about how MNEs conduct themselves with integrity in wartime.\n\n**Discussion Questions:**\n\n* Why do you think Toro does business internationally via distributors? What are the advantages and disadvantages of that approach?\n* Look at the Engo (Russia) website. What percentage of space and text do they devote to promoting Toro and Toro products for turf, lawncare, and golf course maintenance? Put another way, how important is Toro as a (an exclusive) supplier of products and services to Engo?\n* Think about the Toro CEO’s comments about “bad” information regarding Toro’s activities in Russia. Were they false? Were they misleading? Did it matter whether they are one, both, or neither?\n* Why do you think Toro analysts were so apparently uninterested in those comments? What does it tell you about business and finance community interests during wartime?\n\nWHAT DOES EUROPEAN POPULISM MEAN FOR INVESTMENT?                                 **(Session 14)**\n\n**Synopsis.** Populist politics, politicians, and parties are increasingly prominent in the industrialized democracies of Western and Central Europe. What does it mean for investment, particularly foreign-led investment? This session is dedicated to analysis and discussion of near-term populist political and investment trends. We will first review the comments of an economic expert working for a professional investment management company in the Netherlands, APG. Then, we will review findings from what may be the first broad-sample statistical study of foreign- and domestic-led infrastructure investment trends following national elections that lead to ebbs and flows of general, left-wing, and right-wing populist party political support. As you will see from both the comments and study, it is not so much populist politicians and parties that raise concerns for investors, it is *right-wing* populist politicians and parties that raise those concerns for *foreign-led* investors and their projects. We will analyze why that’s the case and what it means not only for Europe but for other parts of the world where right-wing populist parties or wings of such parties are ascendant.\n\n***Discussion Questions:***\n\n* What does “populism” mean to you? Some analysts think there are “varieties” of populism. If so, then how would you describe the European variety based on the comments from the APG expert?\n* In my paper with Chris Hartwell, Barclay James, and Thomas Lindner there are three theories of foreign investment and political risk: opportunistic, partisan, and (partisan) populist. How do the first two contribute to the last one?\n* If you were a non-German MNE looking to invest in a Germany increasingly attracted to right-wing populist parties like the *Alternative für Deutschland* (AfD), what would you do to make that investment give it a more “domestic” look?\n* Are right-wing populist parties good for investment in Europe? Are they good for the US?\n\nHOW MUCH TO GIVE TO TWO CHINESE CITIES                                                              **(Session 15)**\n\nThis course session is dedicated to surveying and applying three perspectives on how firms generally and MNEs more specifically define and discharge social responsibilities: 1) an ethical egoist perspective defining and discharging them based on how much they serve MNE shareholder wealth maximization; 2) a stakeholder utilitarian perspective doing the same based on how much they serve a range of MNE stakeholders; and 3) a corporate citizenship deontological perspective doing the same based on MNE duties to act no matter their impact on shareholders or stakeholders. We’ll survey their histories, logics, and typical applications in MNEs today. Then we’ll apply them to a fictional scenario involving Target and two cities in China where Target sources many of the goods sold in their stores. I’ll go over the facts of this scenario involving natural catastrophes leaving thousands in need of food and homes. I will ask you to apply one of these three CSR perspectives in making recommendations to senior Target executives about how much to donate for how long. I am pretty sure you’re recommendations will differ substantially depending on which CSR perspective guides you.\n\n***Discussion Questions:***\n\n* Define in brief CSR and these three CSR perspectives. Which do you think explains the CSR activities of MNEs in the Twin Cities?\n* For some, Milton Friedman’s 1970 opinion piece in the *New York Times* seems like a heartless statement about CSR. For others, it is a realistic statement about the limitations of the firm as a moral entity and presumptive moral wisdom of firm executives. Where do you fall between these two positions?\n* How do you think Freeman’s formulation of stakeholder theory applies to MNEs with workers domestically and multiple foreign locales? And to domestic and foreign host governments?\n* Schwab describes MNEs as “citizens” with certain global duties to act for social purposes even if the economic benefit of such action is not easy to discern. Isn’t that the province of government?\n\nTHE RANA PLAZA DISASTER                                                                                               **(Session 16)**\n\n**Synopsis.** “Bluewashing” refers to actions taken by firms that appear to serve some social purpose, but are actually meant to serve the firm’s self-interest, usually firm profitability.  This course session is devoted to understanding whether and how that term applies to the actions of Target and other foreign retailers buying from the Bangladesh-based Rana Plaza clothing manufacturing facility while also supposedly assuring the facility’s adherence to high-quality worker safety standards. The 2013 collapse of the facility in 2013 killed hundreds and led to criticism of foreign retailers, including Target for touting statements to stakeholders about their socially responsible approach as a form of advertising. It even led to a lawsuit for damages in Canada against another Canadian retailer, Loblaws. The aim of this course session is to understand when and how MNEs assume this safety oversight role and when it whipsaws on them legally or otherwise.\n\n***Discussion Questions:***\n\n* What intrinsic duties do MNEs owe foreign workers and communities when they engage them as suppliers?\n* How far can an MNE go before it assumes some duty to those workers and communities no matter where you stand on intrinsic duties? Why would any MNE exceed the intrinsic minimum?\n* Would you permit the Rana Plaza case to be heard in Canadian rather than in Bangladeshi courts?\n* After Rana Plaza, how would you advise Target on supervision of safety in other foreign supplier\n\nTHE SUPPLY SIDE: WALMEX, INDIA’S PHONEPe GROW ECOSYSTEMS INSIDE WALMART INTERNATIONAL                                                                                                                     **(Session 17)**\n\n**Synopsis**. The fifth largest country in the world is the virtual country of Diasporia.  There are about 300,000,000 people living in countries where they were not born or raised. The bulk are migrants from countries of the Developing South (*e.g*., Philippines) living and working in countries of the Developed North (*e.g*., US). And those migrants are remitting to their home countries more than $650 billion annually.  Migrant remittances are now the largest foreign capital inflow into most developing countries.  What are the remittances used for? The lion’s share of a remitted dollar (or Euro or Yen) goes to finance household consumption of necessities like food and clothing and healthcare. But a substantial percentage also goes to funding, founding, and growing micro businesses in those same households. So migrants, remittances, and venture investment in developing countries are now an increasingly important part of the social environment of businesses large and small.  In this session we’ll learn how and why.  We’ll also learn how you can exploit business-related opportunities. The WalMex and PhonePe initiatives are two examples of intermediaries looking to exploit business opportunities related to remittances. We will evaluate these and then give you the opportunity to dream up your own “value-added” business idea. Maybe you’ll be the next MNE to win big from remittances.\n\n***Discussion Questions:***\n\n* What is a migrant? What are remittances?  Why have both grown so quickly since 2000?\n* How does economic “informality” change remittance use in a household in a developing country?\n* The WalMex and PhonePe initiatives are two attempts to build profitable ecosystems around migrants and their remittances. How do you evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each?\n* What’s your value-added remittance idea? It doesn’t require you to be a big MNE like WalMart, just someone able to match a remitting migrant’s interest in the host country to a migrant recipient’s need in the home country. Let’s call it “transnational knowledge.”\n\nUNCHARTED TERRITORY: WHY SOME AIRLINES REMOVE ISRAEL FROM THEIR ONLINE ROUTE MAPS                                                                                                                  **(Session 18)**\n\n**Synopsis:** Alliances have been central features of US, European, and other international airline strategies since the 2010s. Reasons for their emergence are varied, but two major reasons stand out: national state regulation of air space and landing rights; and national state ownership of airlines. The first major reason lets national governments favor domestic airlines and airline business objectives. The second lets national governments control domestic airlines and government political objectives. Sometimes the two overlap as in the case of two Delta SkyTeam alliance members, Saudia and MEA (Lebanon). It may seem irrelevant, but both single out Israel for omission as a country on their airline route maps. We’ll analyze why they and a select group of other state-owned airlines from the Middle East “deny” Israel’s existence on their route maps: Is it to support home-country political objectives, airline business (profitability) objectives, or both? Get ready to learn more about “discriminatory product differentiation” among airlines Delta embraces as allies.\n\n***Discussion Questions**:*\n\n* How would you describe the structure of the international airline industry in the mid-2010s?\n* Which alliance is best positioned for success in the 2020s?\n* The 2017 *Economist* article suggests that some international airlines in the 2010s compete by subtly discriminating against Israelis and Jews. But many of these same airlines are also in alliances led by US airlines touting their record of non-discrimination. Which alliance is best positioned to avoid such intra-alliance conflicts in the 2020s?\n\nTRUMP TARIFFS AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY                           **(Session 19)**\n\n**Synopsis**: As I write up this syllabus in early January 2026, it is only a few days before the US Supreme Court is likely to render an opinion on the legality of President Trump’s tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). No matter the opinion, this case highlights new challenges facing foreign businesses trying to export to the US and domestic businesses trying to buy those goods and services. Tariffs like those imposed under the IEEPA raise costs for both firms. This guided discussion is intended to give you a better grounding for how we got to this point and what foreign exporting and US importing firms are doing to mitigate the negative business effects.\n\n***Discussion Questions:***\n\n* What is the origin of the IEEPA? How does it relate to other laws giving the executive branch of the US government so much power to regulate international trade, a power explicitly delegated to the legislative branch under the US Constitution?\n* Explain the reasoning of the US Supreme Court decision on the legality of President Trump’s tariff impositions under the IEEPA.\n* How would you advise a large European MNE exporting to the US on how to mitigate the negative effects of US tariffs?\n* How would you do the same for a small US business importing those goods from Europe?\n\nMANAGING INVESTMENT IN CHAOS:  SOUTHEAST ASIA                                    (**Sessions 21-22**)\n\n**Synopsis**:  It is Spring 2002.  Several countries in Southeast Asia are coping with lingering financial concerns, economic downturns, and political and social tensions stemming from the global economic slowdown and the reminiscent of the “Asian flu” which first gripped the region in the latter half of 1997.  Even so, Southeast Asia remains an attractive target for foreign direct investment, particularly in infrastructure industries like telecommunications, electricity, water and transport. Liberalizing trade regimes, low labor costs and government policies promoting private capital into infrastructure industries are some but certainly not all reasons for Southeast Asia’s enduring attraction. In this context, you may play the role of an MNE potentially investing in one of three Southeast Asian countries:  Malaysia, Singapore or Indonesia.  Your investment would be in either (fresh drinking) water or waste-water treatment facilities. To accomplish that you will need to negotiate with host-country governments from the three countries.  You may play one of those three roles.  There are also local firms in each country eager to work cooperatively with the MNEs and, perhaps, doing so with encouragement from the host-country governments.  You may play one of those six roles.  Whatever your role, you will have an entire evening devoted to figuring out how best to manage the “chaos” of strategic FDI in one of the fastest growing regions of the world.  Good luck!\n\n***Discussion Questions:***\n\n* How does “success” differ for MNEs versus local firms and host-country governments?\n* There are special economic zones (SREZs) that permit lower-cost investment but require the consent of multiple host-country governments. How do you negotiate the distribution of positive “externalities” (recall Boeing-Airbus case readings) between multiple host-country governments?\n* FDI agreements are also always incomplete. There are contingencies not covered by the agreement terms.  Who wins when there are silences in the agreements you will negotiate?  How do the likely “losers” in such cases mitigate their losses?\n* What did you learn about adroit FDI strategy from MICSA?\n\n### Tennessen Warning Notice Pursuant to MN Department of Administration’s Data Practices\n\nTo make this class more accessible to all enrolled students, we intend to record all class lectures and discussions.  Since your audio/video may be part of those recordings we are informing you.  Along with the instructor and teaching assistants, these recordings will be shared with only the students enrolled in the class during this semester, in accordance with FERPA regulations.\n\n### Communication and Canvas Notifications\n\nThe Canvas Notifications system is the main communication tool we will use for course-relevant announcements. If you have not altered your notification settings, you will receive announcements in your UMN email immediately when they are made. If you have altered these settings, it is highly recommended that you reset \"Announcements\" back to \"Notify immediately\" in [your communication settings](https://canvas.umn.edu/profile/communication) as seen below so that you receive notices in a timely manner.\n![Notification frequency settings. 4 options: Notify immediately, Daily summary, Weekly summary, Notifications off](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/sites/carlsonschool.umn.edu/files/announcements_notifications.png)\nYou may also choose to receive notifications through additional channels including a personal email address or push notifications on your phone if you install the Canvas app. Additional channels can be added through your [Canvas Settings](https://canvas.umn.edu/profile/settings).\n\n### Carlson & University Policies\n\n#### Student Academic Misconduct and Scholastic Dishonesty\n\nThe Carlson School defines academic misconduct as any act by a student that misrepresents the student's own academic work or that compromises the academic work of another. Scholastic misconduct includes (but is not limited to) cheating on assignments or examinations, plagiarizing, i.e., misrepresenting as one's own work any work done by another, submitting the same paper, or substantially similar papers, to meet the requirement of more than one course without the approval and consent of the instructors concerned, or sabotaging another's work. Within this general definition, however, instructors determine what constitutes academic misconduct in the courses they teach. Students found guilty of academic misconduct face penalties ranging from lowering of the course grade or awarding a grade of F or N for the entire course, to suspension from the University.\n\nReview the [Student Conduct Code](https://z.umn.edu/policy-carlson_student_conduct_code) and [Student Conduct and Academic Integrity website](https://z.umn.edu/student_conduct_academic_integrity).\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about how to cite sources and avoid plagiarism, U of M libraries offers online [tutorials and tools related to citations](https://z.umn.edu/research_citation_tools).

Students registered with the DRC, who have a letter requesting accommodations, are encouraged to contact the instructor early in the semester. Students who have, or think they may have, a disability (e.g. psychiatric, attention, learning, vision, hearing, physical, or systemic), are invited to contact the DRC for a confidential discussion at 612-626-1333 (V/TTY) or at [drc@umn.edu](mailto:drc@umn.edu). Additional information is available on the [Disability Resource Center website](https://z.umn.edu/disability_resource_center).\n\n#### Title IX\n\n[Title IX](https://z.umn.edu/title_ix_process) prohibits sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and relationship violence, in education.\n\n#### Students with Mental Health and Stress Management\n\nAs a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student's ability to participate in daily activities. University of Minnesota services are available to assist you with addressing these and other concerns you may be experiencing. Learn more about the broad range of confidential [mental health services](https://z.umn.edu/mental_health_services) available on campus.\n\n#### Student Writing Support\n\nAs a student, you may experience challenges in your writing.

Then the world changes, we get over the shock, and business pundits tell us we should’ve seen it (and planned for it) all along. So there. This session begins with four anecdotes about four firms doing business in and with Russia and Ukraine since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Each anecdote comes with a “lesson” for other firms that may face this situation in the near term. We’ll spend more time on one particular anecdote and lesson involving the Toro Corporation and its regional distributor in Russia and the Ukraine, Engo. I want you to read through the transcript of Toro’s quarterly earnings call with analysts from March 2022, only weeks after Russia’s invasion began and Western countries aghast at Russia’s aggression imposed economic sanctions leading to business closures and exits throughout Russia. Opening comments from Toro’s CEO sought to anticipate and neutralize claims that the company was still doing business in Russia. Look closely at those comments and then the lack of any analyst follow-up questions about those comments. Then look at the Engo website and contemporary statements by Engo’s CEO Norbert Zatko (translated via Google from Russian to English). Something’s amiss. We’ll discuss that and see where it takes us about how MNEs conduct themselves with integrity in wartime.\n\n **Discussion Questions:**\n\n* Why do you think Toro does business internationally via distributors? What are the advantages and disadvantages of that approach?\n* Look at the Engo (Russia) website. What percentage of space and text do they devote to promoting Toro and Toro products for turf, lawncare, and golf course maintenance? Put another way, how important is Toro as a (an exclusive) supplier of products and services to Engo?\n* Think about the Toro CEO’s comments about “bad” information regarding Toro’s activities in Russia.

(CHECK THIS)***](https://apg.nl/en/publication/what-does-european-populism-mean-for-investments/)\n\n**Synopsis.** Populist politics, politicians, and parties are increasingly prominent in the industrialized democracies of Western and Central Europe. What does it mean for investment, particularly foreign-led investment? This session is dedicated to analysis and discussion of near-term populist political and investment trends. We will first review the comments of an economic expert working for a professional investment management company in the Netherlands, APG. Then, we will review findings from what may be the first broad-sample statistical study of foreign- and domestic-led infrastructure investment trends following national elections that lead to ebbs and flows of general, left-wing, and right-wing populist party political support. As you will see from both the comments and study, it is not so much populist politicians and parties that raise concerns for investors, it is *right-wing* populist politicians and parties that raise those concerns for *foreign-led* investors and their projects. We will analyze why that’s the case and what it means not only for Europe but for other parts of the world where right-wing populist parties or wings of such parties are ascendant.\n\n **Discussion Questions:**\n\n* What does “populism” mean to you? Some analysts think there are “varieties” of populism. If so, then how would you describe the European variety based on the comments from the APG expert?\n* In my paper with Chris Hartwell, Barclay James, and Thomas Lindner there are three theories of foreign investment and political risk: opportunistic, partisan, and (partisan) populist. How do the first two contribute to the last one?\n* If you were a non-German MNE looking to invest in a Germany increasingly attracted to right-wing populist parties like the *Alternative für Deutschland* (AfD), what would you do to make that investment give it a more “domestic” look?\n* Are right-wing populist parties good for investment in Europe? Are they good for the US?\n\n \n\n**<Slides>**\n\n**<Recording>**\n", "metadata": {"course_folder": "MGMT6305-2026-SP__canvas_545013", "course_id": "MGMT6305", "doc_type": "page", "title": "Week 7: The International Political Environment (March 4)", "source_url": "https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/pages/week-7-the-international-political-environment-march-4", "canvas_course_id": 545013, "canvas_assignment_id": null, "page_url": "week-7-the-international-political-environment-march-4", "updated_at": "2026-01-09T21:01:07Z", "due_at": null, "linked_from_module": true, "module_name": "Module 3: The International Political Environment", "canvas_module_id": 2577541, "module_item_type": "Page", "module_item_id": 15605743, "module_item_position": 2, "module_item_published": null, "exported_html": "html/pages/Week 7 The International Political Environment March 4.html", "converted_md": "md/pages/Week 7 The International Political Environment March 4.md"}}

We’ll survey their histories, logics, and typical applications in MNEs today. Then we’ll apply them to a fictional scenario involving Target and two cities in China where Target sources many of the goods sold in their stores. I’ll go over the facts of this scenario involving natural catastrophes leaving thousands in need of food and homes. I will ask you to apply one of these three CSR perspectives in making recommendations to senior Target executives about how much to donate for how long. I am pretty sure you’re recommendations will differ substantially depending on which CSR perspective guides you.\n\n **Discussion Questions:**\n\n* Define in brief CSR and these three CSR perspectives. Which do you think explains the CSR activities of MNEs in the Twin Cities?\n* For some, Milton Friedman’s 1970 opinion piece in the *New York Times* seems like a heartless statement about CSR. For others, it is a realistic statement about the limitations of the firm as a moral entity and presumptive moral wisdom of firm executives. Where do you fall between these two positions?\n* How do you think Freeman’s formulation of stakeholder theory applies to MNEs with workers domestically and multiple foreign locales? And to domestic and foreign host governments?\n* Schwab describes MNEs as “citizens” with certain global duties to act for social purposes even if the economic benefit of such action is not easy to discern. Isn’t that the province of government?\n\n \n\n### Session 16: Wednesday, March 18, 2026, 7:35-9:05pm\n\n**SUBJECT:** The International “Bluewashing” Environment\n\n**READING**:\n\nBurkett, C. & Bernardo, J. 2015.

The 2013 collapse of the facility in 2013 killed hundreds and led to criticism of foreign retailers, including Target for touting statements to stakeholders about their socially responsible approach as a form of advertising. It even led to a lawsuit for damages in Canada against another Canadian retailer, Loblaws. The aim of this course session is to understand when and how MNEs assume this safety oversight role and when it whipsaws on them legally or otherwise. \n\n **Discussion Questions:**\n\n* What intrinsic duties do MNEs owe foreign workers and communities when they engage them as suppliers?\n* How far can an MNE go before it assumes some duty to those workers and communities no matter where you stand on intrinsic duties? Why would any MNE exceed the intrinsic minimum?\n* Would you permit the Rana Plaza case to be heard in Canadian rather than in Bangladeshi courts?\n* After Rana Plaza, how would you advise Target on supervision of safety in other foreign supplier?\n\n**<Slides>**\n\n**<Recordings>**\n", "metadata": {"course_folder": "MGMT6305-2026-SP__canvas_545013", "course_id": "MGMT6305", "doc_type": "page", "title": "Week 8: The International Social Environment (March 18)", "source_url": "https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/pages/week-8-the-international-social-environment-march-18", "canvas_course_id": 545013, "canvas_assignment_id": null, "page_url": "week-8-the-international-social-environment-march-18", "updated_at": "2026-01-08T02:36:19Z", "due_at": null, "linked_from_module": true, "module_name": "Module 4: The International Social Environment", "canvas_module_id": 2577542, "module_item_type": "Page", "module_item_id": 15605744, "module_item_position": 1, "module_item_published": null, "exported_html": "html/pages/Week 8 The International Social Environment March 18.html", "converted_md": "md/pages/Week 8 The International Social Environment March 18.md"}}

The company wanted to expand the reach of its own franchised coffee bar, *Espressamente*, through international expansion. Potential markets included Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, India, the United Kingdom and the United States. In addition to market selection, mode of entry was vital and included options such as exporting, franchising and joint venture. This case provides a practical example of the challenges faced in international business.  It also gives us an opportunity to understand alternative internationalization paths.  Do MNEs and SMEs follow economic or sociological considerations when taking that path?  Do they care more about a foreign country’s market size or cultural similarity?\n\n **Discussion Questions:**\n\n* Is espresso coffee retailing a global industry? What do you think is the most important factor behind Illy’s efforts to internationalize operations.?\n* And what about the pattern of internationalization? How does the path of foreign market entry and development confirm, disconfirm or perhaps render irrelevant Hofstede’s ideas about cultural distance and business practices across certain country groups?\n* Maybe Illy’s luck is running out. The last big national market for its product, the US is approaching maturity in the industry product life cycle is reaching maturity in other countries worth entering.  Defend or attack this assessment.  No fence-sitting allowed.\n\n \n\n### Session 4: Wednesday, January 28, 2026, 7:35-9:05pm\n\n**SUBJECT:** How Do Firms Organize to Internationalize?\n\n**READINGS:**\n\nBartlett, C. & Ghoshal, S. 2003.

HBSP #9-10-410\n\n**Synopsis:**  This case contrasts the development of Philips' and Matsushita's international organizations and associated organizational capabilities. Philips, with fully developed national organizations abroad, struggles to coordinate its operations on a global scale, but encounters strong resistance to organizational and cultural changes. Grim financial results in early 1990s cast doubt on the company's previous 20 years of organizational and strategic change. Matsushita, the highly centralized industry leader, struggles to internationalize its organization by decentralizing assets, responsibilities, and decision making. Its attempts to build independent national organizations abroad are equally disappointing.  This case gives us an opportunity to raise issues relating internal strategy processes and structures to external global strategy content.  In short, how does MNE internal process and structure influence external conflict between the MNE and other firms?\n\n **Discussion Questions:**\n\n* How did Philips become the leading consumer electronics company in the world in the postwar era? What distinctive resources/abilities/competencies did Philips build?  What distinctive disadvantages?\n* How did Matsushita succeed in displacing Philips as No. 1? What were its distinctive resources/abilities/competencies?  And its distinctive disadvantages?\n* What do you think of the change each MNE has made to date -objectives, implementation, impact? Why is the change so hard for both of them?\n* What recommendations would you make to the Philips CEO? To the Matushita CEO?\n\n**<Slides>**\n\n[Vaaler\\_IEB\\_Session3\\_Spring2026.pptx](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/files/59349133?wrap=1 \"Vaaler_IEB_Session3_Spring2026.pptx\")\n\n[Vaaler\\_IEB\\_Session3\\_Spring2026.pdf](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/files/59349130?wrap=1 \"Vaaler_IEB_Session3_Spring2026.pdf\")\n\n[Vaaler\\_IEB\\_Session4\\_Spring2026.pptx](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/files/59349132?wrap=1 \"Vaaler_IEB_Session4_Spring2026.pptx\")\n\n[Vaaler\\_IEB\\_Session4\\_Spring2026.pdf](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/files/59349131?wrap=1 \"Vaaler_IEB_Session4_Spring2026.pdf\")\n\n**<Recordings>**\n\n[Session Recording](https://umn.zoom.us/rec/share/9-y_zcxuxkZyZlyKNLP61YKNcrduw3ABsufV6InaqIjWFtuUGGZfEw-ebFvMVKwP.kHXZjoTLF0lR-LpX)\n", "metadata": {"course_folder": "MGMT6305-2026-SP__canvas_545013", "course_id": "MGMT6305", "doc_type": "page", "title": "Week 2: IEB Foundations (January 28)", "source_url": "https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/pages/week-2-ieb-foundations-january-28", "canvas_course_id": 545013, "canvas_assignment_id": null, "page_url": "week-2-ieb-foundations-january-28", "updated_at": "2026-01-29T12:45:47Z", "due_at": null, "linked_from_module": true, "module_name": "Module 1: IEB Foundations", "canvas_module_id": 2577539, "module_item_type": "Page", "module_item_id": 15605738, "module_item_position": 2, "module_item_published": null, "exported_html": "html/pages/Week 2 IEB Foundations January 28.html", "converted_md": "md/pages/Week 2 IEB Foundations January 28.md"}}

Although the project presented a unique opportunity to alleviate poverty in Chad, one of the poorest countries in the world, Chad had a president who had been labeled \"warlord\" and a history of civil war and oppression. This case describes the project, the setting, and the World Bank's reasons for participating in the deal--mainly an opportunity to alleviate poverty, enforce environmental standards, and minimize the impact on indigenous people. It also describes the very public and very ardent opposition to the project's environmental, social, and revenue management policies. Faced with a high-risk, but potentially high-return opportunity to improve conditions in Chad, students, we’ll discuss decide whether it is wise to approve funding for the deal.  This case illustrates not only the complexity of negotiating very large deals between public and private entities, but also the opportunity inherent in large-scale investment. We’ll assess whether the benefits received by the host countries are commensurate with the risks they bear. This discussion raises critical ethical issues related to investment in developing countries. With regard to project finance, the case illustrates the difference between project and corporate finance and shows that risk sharing and risk mitigation are motivations for using project finance.\n\n **Discussion Questions:**\n\n* What is political risk?

The *Brands* case provides us with an opportunity to see how such transactions are negotiated between merchants, and how state and national versus international legal regimes regarding sales contracts and their interpretation differ. Among other points, *Brands* highlights the importance of carefully writing draft agreements, especially when those drafts address choice of law for their interpretation when breached. In this case, a contract for delivery of hand sanitizer on behalf of Canada-based Brands by Minnesota-based Reach failed to expressly exclude application of a separate international legal regime summarized under the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). So the CISG rather than Minnesota law governed the contract. The big issue for the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit was about whether Brands could collect attorneys’ fees from Reach for Reach’s breach of contract. The Eighth Circuit’s 2024 opinion about whether Brands could recover those fees under the CISG reversed a 2023 decision by the lower US District Court for the District of Minnesota. At first glance, the 2024 decision seemed surprising. We’ll show why it wasn’t and what it means going forward for small, medium, and large MNEs doing business around the world.\n\n **Discussion Questions:**\n\n* Why does the CISG apply to the transaction in dispute between Brands and Reach (and how do you know)?\n* Assuming that Minnesota law governed the contract, do you think Brands would still have been able to recover attorneys’ fees from Reach?\n* What sources of law did the Eighth Circuit refer to in reversing the lower court and awarding Brands attorneys fees?\n* It’s pretty clear that the attorneys for both Brands and Reach –both large MNEs— didn’t understand how choice of law rules worked in an international transaction. What does that tell you about how law matters in international transaction negotiation and dispute resolution?\n\n### Session 8: Wednesday, February 11, 2026, 7:35-9:05pm\n\n**SUBJECT:** The International Private Arbitration Environment\n\n**READING:**\n\nAmerican Arbitration Association. 2013.

They are given to one, two or only a few MNEs dominating the market.  Long-haul civil aircraft manufacturing may be one those industries.  If so, then it’s a “winner-take-all” or “winner-take-most” fight by the two MNEs seeking that domination: US-based Boeing and Europe-based Airbus.  Both have benefited from government support. Airbus was created as an entity owned by several European states. Boeing was always a privately-owned entity but received substantial US government revenue as a prime defense contractor.  Both MNEs think that support (and more) justified as they mull over whether and how to develop a new generation of superjumbo jet offerings for the travelling public.  Isn’t it “good” public policy for home-country governments to subsidize their national champion MNEs if that subsidy could help their MNE win the global market and shower the home country with all sorts of positive externalities:  more employment, technology, wealth, military power, independence and influence.  That’s the setting for our case where Boeing and Airbus (and their respective home-country governments) are mulling over whether to cooperate or compete in the production of superjumbo jets in the 1990s and 2000s, and then live with that decision in the 2010s. \n\n **Discussion Questions:**\n\n* What are the characteristics of a global industry?\n* Are there differences that matter between the subsidies that Airbus and Boeing receive? How do their respective home-country governments justify those subsidies?\n* What is “industrial policy” according to Krugman, Obstfeld and Melitz? How does their view of industrial policy differ with Michael Porter’s explanation of government’s role in fostering firm competitive advantages?\n* What is “strategic trade policy” and how does it matter in the Brander-Spence model of trade?\n* How do you explain the different decisions about whether to produce superjumbo jets at Airbus and Boeing?\n\n### **Session 6: Wednesday, February 4, 2026, 7:35-9:05pm**\n\n**SUBJECT:** Initial Group Meetings to Discuss Company Reports\n\n**READING:** None\n\n**CASE DISCUSSION:** None\n\n**<Slides>**\n\n[Vaaler\\_IEB\\_Sessions5\\_6\\_Spring2026.pptx](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/files/59561392?wrap=1 \"Vaaler_IEB_Sessions5_6_Spring2026.pptx\")\n\n[Vaaler\\_IEB\\_Sessions5\\_6\\_Spring2026.pdf](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/files/59561393?wrap=1 \"Vaaler_IEB_Sessions5_6_Spring2026.pdf\")\n\n**<Recording>**\n", "metadata": {"course_folder": "MGMT6305-2026-SP__canvas_545013", "course_id": "MGMT6305", "doc_type": "page", "title": "Week 3: IEB Foundations (February 4)", "source_url": "https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/pages/week-3-ieb-foundations-february-4", "canvas_course_id": 545013, "canvas_assignment_id": null, "page_url": "week-3-ieb-foundations-february-4", "updated_at": "2026-02-04T23:44:49Z", "due_at": null, "linked_from_module": true, "module_name": "Module 1: IEB Foundations", "canvas_module_id": 2577539, "module_item_type": "Page", "module_item_id": 15605739, "module_item_position": 3, "module_item_published": null, "exported_html": "html/pages/Week 3 IEB Foundations February 4.html", "converted_md": "md/pages/Week 3 IEB Foundations February 4.md"}}

No matter the opinion, this case highlights new challenges facing foreign businesses trying to export to the US and domestic businesses trying to buy those goods and services.

The fifth largest country in the world is the virtual country of Diasporia.  There are about 300,000,000 people living in countries where they were not born or raised. The bulk are migrants from countries of the Developing South (*e.g*., Philippines) living and working in countries of the Developed North (*e.g*., US). And those migrants are remitting to their home countries more than $650 billion annually.  Migrant remittances are now the largest foreign capital inflow into most developing countries.  What are the remittances used for? The lion’s share of a remitted dollar (or Euro or Yen) goes to finance household consumption of necessities like food and clothing and healthcare. But a substantial percentage also goes to funding, founding, and growing micro businesses in those same households. So migrants, remittances, and venture investment in developing countries are now an increasingly important part of the social environment of businesses large and small.  In this session we’ll learn how and why.  We’ll also learn how you can exploit business-related opportunities. The WalMex and PhonePe initiatives are two examples of intermediaries looking to exploit business opportunities related to remittances. We will evaluate these and then give you the opportunity to dream up your own “value-added” business idea. Maybe you’ll be the next MNE to win big from remittances.\n\n**Discussion Questions:**\n\n* What is a migrant? What are remittances?  Why have both grown so quickly since 2000?\n* How does economic “informality” change remittance use in a household in a developing country?\n* The WalMex and PhonePe initiatives are two attempts to build profitable ecosystems around migrants and their remittances. How do you evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each?\n* What’s your value-added remittance idea? It doesn’t require you to be a big MNE like WalMart, just someone able to match a remitting migrant’s interest in the host country to a migrant recipient’s need in the home country. Let’s call it “transnational knowledge.”\n\n \n\n### Session 18: Wednesday, March 25, 2026, 7:35-9:05pm\n\n**SUBJECT:** Discrimination and International Marketing\n\n**READINGS:**\n\nEconomist. 2017.

Reasons for their emergence are varied, but two major reasons stand out: national state regulation of air space and landing rights; and national state ownership of airlines. The first major reason lets national governments favor domestic airlines and airline business objectives. The second lets national governments control domestic airlines and government political objectives. Sometimes the two overlap as in the case of two Delta SkyTeam alliance members, Saudia and MEA (Lebanon). It may seem irrelevant, but both single out Israel for omission as a country on their airline route maps. We’ll analyze why they and a select group of other state-owned airlines from the Middle East “deny” Israel’s existence on their route maps: Is it to support home-country political objectives, airline business (profitability) objectives, or both? Get ready to learn more about “discriminatory product differentiation” among airlines Delta embraces as allies.\n\n**Discussion Questions**:\n\n* How would you describe the structure of the international airline industry in the mid-2010s?\n* Which alliance is best positioned for success in the 2020s?\n* The 2017 *Economist* article suggests that some international airlines in the 2010s compete by subtly discriminating against Israelis and Jews. But many of these same airlines are also in alliances led by US airlines touting their record of non-discrimination. Which alliance is best positioned to avoid such intra-alliance conflicts in the 2020s?\n\n**<Slides>**\n\n**<Recording>**\n", "metadata": {"course_folder": "MGMT6305-2026-SP__canvas_545013", "course_id": "MGMT6305", "doc_type": "page", "title": "Week 9: The International Social Environment (March 25)", "source_url": "https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/pages/week-9-the-international-social-environment-march-25", "canvas_course_id": 545013, "canvas_assignment_id": null, "page_url": "week-9-the-international-social-environment-march-25", "updated_at": "2026-01-11T18:42:27Z", "due_at": null, "linked_from_module": true, "module_name": "Module 4: The International Social Environment", "canvas_module_id": 2577542, "module_item_type": "Page", "module_item_id": 15605745, "module_item_position": 2, "module_item_published": null, "exported_html": "html/pages/Week 9 The International Social Environment March 25.html", "converted_md": "md/pages/Week 9 The International Social Environment March 25.md"}}

Lincoln Electric is a Cleveland-based welding services firm that has already gone abroad as an MNC but is now considering India as  new international market.  Lincoln’s CEO is mulling over whether to invest in India, and if so, with what form of FDI.  You will help him with that decision.  First, we’ll ground it in a broader theoretical framework explaining when it makes sense for firms to go abroad as an MNC or SME.  It is the ownership-location-internalization (OLI) framework.  The OLI framework might also help in addressing the second question about how to enter.\n\n**Discussion Questions:**\n\n* Should Lincoln Electric enter India?\n* If so, should Lincoln Electric own a manufacturing operation there? If so, then should the company acquire a local player or build their own greenfield plant?\n* If a joint venture is preferred, then think about how Lincoln Electric will ensure its ability to make key business decisions in India.\n* John Dunning analyzes the decision to internationalize a firm’s operations as a function of that firm’s ownership, location and internalization (OLI) factors. How do you apply the OLI factors to Lincoln Electric and its decision about whether to enter India.\n\n**<Slides>**\n\n[Vaaler\\_IEB\\_Session1\\_Spring2026.pptx](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/files/59162783?wrap=1 \"Vaaler_IEB_Session1_Spring2026.pptx\")\n\n[Vaaler\\_IEB\\_Session1\\_Spring2026.pdf](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/files/59162787?wrap=1 \"Vaaler_IEB_Session1_Spring2026.pdf\")\n\n[Vaaler\\_IEB\\_Session2\\_Spring2026.pptx](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/files/59162785?wrap=1 \"Vaaler_IEB_Session2_Spring2026.pptx\")\n\n[Vaaler\\_IEB\\_Session2\\_Spring2026.pdf](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/files/59162786?wrap=1 \"Vaaler_IEB_Session2_Spring2026.pdf\")\n\n**<Recordings>**\n", "metadata": {"course_folder": "MGMT6305-2026-SP__canvas_545013", "course_id": "MGMT6305", "doc_type": "page", "title": "Week 1: IEB Foundations (January 21)", "source_url": "https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/545013/pages/week-1-ieb-foundations-january-21", "canvas_course_id": 545013, "canvas_assignment_id": null, "page_url": "week-1-ieb-foundations-january-21", "updated_at": "2026-01-21T23:43:47Z", "due_at": null, "linked_from_module": true, "module_name": "Module 1: IEB Foundations", "canvas_module_id": 2577539, "module_item_type": "Page", "module_item_id": 15605737, "module_item_position": 1, "module_item_published": null, "exported_html": "html/pages/Week 1 IEB Foundations January 21.html", "converted_md": "md/pages/Week 1 IEB Foundations January 21.md"}}

How do MNEs sue a sovereign state? Up until the early 1960s the question was irrelevant. MNEs couldn’t. Then countries started signing international investment agreements (IIAs) including investor state dispute resolution terms permitting such suits under certain conditions. The *Finley* case helps us understand how such suits can go forward under two of the most important IIAs: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) enacted in the early 1990s under the Clinton administration; and the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) enacted in the late 2010s under the (first) Trump administration. The *Finley* cases applies both IIAs, so we can get a sense of how both differ in the rights and obligations they impose on MNEs trying to hold states to account. The Finley case is long. First, browse through it just to get a sense of how long and winding a road it is for MNEs like Finley to exploit IIAs, particularly the newer USMCA. Then try to acquaint yourselves with the facts of the alleged breach of contract by Mexico’s state-owned subsidiary of Pemex, PEP.  Finally, look at the conclusion of the decision by the ICSID tribunal ultimately awarding damages –money— to Finley. Was it all worth it for Finley?\n\n**Discussion Questions:**\n\n* Which dispute resolution mechanisms were more effective for Finley in its dispute with the Mexican government?\n* How do NAFTA-based dispute resolution terms differ with USMCA-based terms?\n* Look at the McMillans LLP publication analyzing different ways to sue states under the USMCA. A direct lawsuit by an MNE against a state isn’t the only way to try and hold a state accountable. What’s wrong with using those alternatives?\n* If, after studying the *Finley* case, you were advising other small- or medium-sized MNEs about how IIAs “protect” themselves in transactions with foreign states, what advice would you emphasize?\n\n### Session 10: Wednesday, February 18, 2026, 7:35-9:05pm\n\n**SUBJECT:** The International Bribery and Corruption Environment\n\n**READINGS:**\n\nSEC. 2023 [***Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)***](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement/foreign-corrupt-practices-act).US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): Washington, DC.\n\nSEC. 2023.

Issues of bribery and corruption often confront MNEs, particularly when dealing with host-country government officials, and particularly in developing countries. The US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is a US response to that issue with its origins in two notorious instances of bribery involving the sale of military planes to Japan and civil aircraft to Pakistan. Since then, the FCPA has undergone several revisions and other wealthier industrialized countries in Western Europe and the Pacific have enacted similar laws. The 2023 3M China bribery case is important to understand not just to see how the FCPA works in practice but to understand how easy it is to detect by MNE headquarters and then respond to effectively. It is pretty clear that 3M’s healthcare subsidiary operations in China were bribing Chinese health ministry officials for years before 3M’s headquarters in suburban St. Paul discovered it. After this case was settled, 3M “spun off” its healthcare division into a separate MNE. Reviewing this case in light of the subsequent spin off will help us understand how MNE organization and oversight capability matter for the control of bribery abroad.\n\n **Discussion Questions:**\n\n* Look at the summary description of the FCPA and the summary of 3M’s FCPA violation in two documents published online by the SEC. What were the elements of 3M’s FCPA violation?\n* At first glance, the fines and disgorgement 3M paid out to settle the FCPA violations seemed to be pretty small compared to the business advantages 3M likely gained over the years it bribed Chinese health officials with luxury trips to “educational” conferences. What other costs do you think 3M’s FCPA violations prompted?\n* In 2023, 3M’s healthcare division was one of many in a highly diversified MNE. The spin-off of the healthcare division into a separate company in 2024 meant that the new MNE would serve only one industry.

To enable this, I will try to be available as much as possible during our synchronous class sessions and at the end of each day to briefly discuss anything that would be helpful for your career and leadership development. If you would like to have a lengthier chat or focused discussion, let’s set up a time. Please book time with me directly via Calendly by scheduling a slot that works for you (we’ll both automatically receive a calendar invite with a Zoom link): <https://calendly.com/campbele/30min>\n\nIf the slots that I keep available for students do not work for you, please email me with several proposed alternatives (including Saturday or Sunday, if need be).\n\n### Teaching Assistant\n\n#### Aaron Piscione\n\n**Email:** [pisci019@umn.edu](mailto:pisci019@umn.edu)\n\nWe are fortunate to have several talented TAs keeping us organized and assisting us, led by Aaron Piscione ([pisci019@umn.edu](mailto:pisci019@umn.edu)). They’ll be behind the scenes, managing customized reports and Canvas, etc. Please pay attention to any emails they send—and be nice to them!\n\n### Course Description\n\n*Wanting to lead and believing you can lead are the departure points on the path to leadership. Leadership is an art - a performing art - and the instrument is the self. The mastery of the art of leadership comes with the mastery of the self. Ultimately, leadership development is a process of self-development. --**The Leadership Challenge*\n\n*We judge ourselves by our intentions. And others by their actions.  - Stephen R. Covey.*\n\nOrganizations spend billions of dollars each year on leadership training and development programs. Effective leadership is considered essential for organizations, though defining effective leadership is often ambiguous and always contextually-dependent. Enacting effective leadership practices presents an enormous challenge for most individuals. Our course’s focus is to prepare and equip you to improve your confidence and capabilities to lead yourself, your projects, and others in the future.\n\nWe will do this by providing you with opportunities to deepen your understanding of effective leadership, examine where you are in your leadership development, and hone your skills. Although the course content is informed by leadership theory and empirical evidence, our focus centers on understanding your personal leadership strengths and vulnerabilities through feedback while developing your leadership skills through practice. The course is *interactive.* **If you want a course where you can sit back and just listen, this is not it**. All students will actively participate in discussions and exercises, practice leadership behaviors, reflect on their behaviors, chart ways to take action on their personal and professional priorities, and create a customized leadership development plan, which I hope proves to be the most formative deliverable of your graduate studies.\n\n#### Course Objectives\n\n* *To facilitate students’ personal growth and development through the process of self-examination and external feedback*\n* *To teach the principles and practices of effective leadership*\n* *To aid students in the development of leadership skills through reflection and practice*\n* *To fuel students’ commitment to a specific, challenging, and ongoing process of leadership and personal development*\n\n#### Course Assumptions & Expectations\n\nThe fundamental assumption guiding the design of this course is that to improve your leadership skills, **you must know from what point you are starting**. Thus, over the course of this class, you will be evaluated extensively—by yourself, by your classmates, and by me. Will this always be comfortable? Of course not! You must be willing to accept this evaluative process and the vulnerability it entails. Though being evaluated is somewhat uncomfortable for most of us, you may find it one of the most beneficial aspects of the course.\n\n**Below are additional assumptions that we all operate under for this course.**\n\n* We enjoy working and learning.\n* We all have different needs and styles.\n* We treat each other with dignity and respect, valuing individual, political, and cultural differences.\n* We communicate frequently and with candor, listening to one another ***to learn all we can***.\n* We arrive on time for class sessions, stay attentive, and come prepared out of respect for our classmates.\n\n### Course Meeting Information\n\n**Sec 050:** Fridays, February 6th, 13th, and 27th\n\n**Time/Place:** 8am - 10am (ASYNCHRONOUS/on your own); 10 - 5pm (LIVE SYNCHRONOUS ON ZOOM/REMOTE)\n\n**Sec 051:** Saturdays, February 7th, 14th, and 28th\n\n**Time/Place:** 8am - 10am (ASYNCHRONOUS/on your own); 10 - 5pm (LIVE SYNCHRONOUS ON ZOOM/REMOTE)\n\n### Tennessen Warning Notice Pursuant to MN Department of Administration’s Data Practices\n\nTo make this class more accessible to all enrolled students, we intend to record all class lectures and discussions.  Since your audio/video may be part of those recordings we are informing you.  Along with the instructor and teaching assistants, these recordings will be shared with only the students enrolled in the class during this semester, in accordance with FERPA regulations.\n\n### Communication and Canvas Notifications\n\nThe Canvas Notifications system is the main communication tool we will use for course-relevant announcements. If you have not altered your notification settings, you will receive announcements in your UMN email immediately when they are made. If you have altered these settings, it is highly recommended that you reset \"Announcements\" back to \"Notify immediately\" in [your communication settings](https://canvas.umn.edu/profile/communication) as seen below so that you receive notices in a timely manner.\n![Notification frequency settings. 4 options: Notify immediately, Daily summary, Weekly summary, Notifications off](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/sites/carlsonschool.umn.edu/files/announcements_notifications.png)\nYou may also choose to receive notifications through additional channels, including a personal email address or push notifications on your phone if you install the Canvas app. Additional channels can be added through your [Canvas Settings](https://canvas.umn.edu/profile/settings).\n\n### Required Materials & Tools\n\n* Kouzes, J. M. & Posner, B. Z. (2012 or 2016; cheap: $0 – $25) The Leadership Challenge. 6th or 7th Edition. (E-book linked on the Canvas site, but you may want your own hardcopy of this book). The substantive content for both books is very similar. The 7th Edition relies on updated examples, but either version is fine and will prepare you sufficiently for discussions.\n* Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI online); pricey: $160, which already includes a 20% discount that I negotiated; **must use UMINN promo code**). This 360-degree leadership assessment must be ordered directly from Wiley Publishing. Order details are provided in a separate document. Ordering and completing the self-assessment swiftly will help your pre-work.\n* Experiential & Reflection Exercises, Assessments, and Mini Cases (distributed in class, online, on Canvas, and/or in email; due to the cost of the 360-assessment, I have worked to find/write/make free versions of supplemental materials and exercises).\n\n### Coursework and Assignment Summary\n\nLeadership skills are best learned by ***integrating*** and ***applying*** data-driven theoretical concepts to practical situations. These skills are difficult to meaningfully assess with exams. Thus, rather than traditional examinations, we will learn the material with practical exercises and apply the course materials to our lives as a leader. Each class will consist of a discussion of the conceptual material and exercises designed to bring these concepts to life.\n\nOur expectation is that we all will attend all classes, come having read all the assigned readings before class, and be prepared to discuss it. To get the most out of the course, and to maximally benefit from the exercises, you must read and complete the assignments in advance and be an active participant in class.\n\nGrades will be based on below course requirements. I have constructed the class deliverables to build on each other. In particular, thoughtful and on-time completion of class pre-work will advantage the quality and usefulness of your final leadership development paper (the big course deliverable). Please ***consult grading rubrics that I posted online*** and ask me if you have questions about any specific assignment. The follow table summarizes course deliverables and due dates.\n\n#### Assignment Summary of Course Deliverables and Due Dates\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Assignment | Due Date & Turn-in Method | % of total |\n| **1. Baseline Assessments**  (A) LPI 360 (self-assessment & choose raters\\*\\*)  *\\*\\*your raters’ assessments of you are due 2/12, but we'll be gentle & flexible with reminders to them.*  (B) Leader Assessment of Motivations and Personality (LAMP) | *(grades based upon **on-time** completion)* (A) Take LPI self-assessment online by Thursday, 2/5, 11:59pm CT  (B) Take LAMP self-assessment online by Thursday, 2/5, Noon CT | 15% |\n| **2. Leadership Challenge Initial Reflection**  *\\*\\*This requires reading our course book and familiarity with its foundational content.* | Submit to Canvas by Thursday, 2/12, by 11:59pm CT | 10% |\n| **3. Reflection Exercises & Support Assignments** | On-time completion of short assignments posted to Canvas *(i.e., responses to reflection questions, self-assessments, mini-case questions related to leader behavior, etc.)* | 15% |\n| **4.

Early Submission Deadline: Mon, 3/9 by 11:59pm CT  Extended Submission Deadline: Fri, 3/13 by 11:59pm CT | 40% |\n| **5. Class Citizenship, Contribution, & Professionalism** | *(graded by both peers and instructor at the end of the last session based on engagement, quality of contributions and questions)* | 20% |\n\n####\n\n#### Assignment Detail\n\n1. **Baseline Assessment Pre-work.**\n   1. **Leader Assessment of Motivations and Personality (LAMP).** Complete the online survey. This feeds the course reports you will receive. I highly recommend that you take this on a computer (i.e., not a phone) and in one sitting. The survey takes about 15-20 minutes to thoughtfully complete. This information will help you understand your leadership tendencies and default reactions, as well as feed several course exercises. The survey link is posted on Canvas and embedded in the first course email.\n   2. **Leadership Practices Inventory 360 Online.** You and ***at least six observers*** (direct reports, peers, past teammates, colleagues, supervisors, coaches, or others you have worked with in a group and who have had the opportunity to experience and/or observe your work behaviors and you impact on others) will complete an inventory designed to assess your leadership style and behaviors. The more observers, the better! I recommend that you pick **at least 8 raters**. Anticipate that some people will not respond. We will talk about this more in class, and I will leave the assessment open for you to seek additional raters after the initial deadline. Details are included in the **LPI 360 – Step by Step Setup Guide** available on the course website and attached to the first course email.\n2. ****Leadership Challenge Initial Reflection.****\n\n   The purpose of this reflection exercise is to stimulate your reflection, awareness, and analysis of your own leadership behaviors, default style, and the current scope and quality of influence. I want you to thoughtfully consider where you are in your development as a leader—right now (not where you think you “should be”).\n\n   Details are included in the **Leadership Challenge Initial Reflection - Detailed Instructions & Rubric** on Canvas. To enable a clear understanding of how reflection exercises will be evaluated, I have also posted the grading rubric. Historically, students have sometimes struggled to offer evidence to their analysis (i.e., reference specific **behaviors** or demonstrate cause-effect of behaviors). Make sure you’re pushing beyond “I think” and “I feel” in your analysis.\n3. **Reflection Exercises & Support Assignments.** Throughout the class, there will be reflection exercises and assessments that I will furnish in our sessions and on Canvas that are designed to help you understand your values, default traits, work styles, etc. How you use them is optional but completing them is not. If completing them makes you think and introspect (and occasionally feel uncomfortable/vulnerable), brilliant! I’ll be thrilled. Personal growth is rarely painless and requires ever-increasing self-awareness. I will not be grading this for deep insights, length, or quality, but I encourage you not to phone these in. Quality work and introspection on these assignments will help you write a more valuable and actionable Leadership Development Plan.\n4. **Final Leadership Development Plan.** Other assignments in the course pave the way for this, our big-ticket deliverable. The purpose of your Final Leadership Development paper is to chart a longer-term vision and short-term roadmap for your personal development. This should be the most valuable assignment for you and represent something that serves you long after the course ends. It takes the form of one paper comprised of three parts. I have posted several strong exemplar papers on Canvas. To enable a detailed understanding of how your paper will be evaluated, I have posted the rubric I will follow while grading. Please see the Final Leadership Development Paper – Details & Rubric on Canvas.\n   1. **Long-term LD Strategy.** You cannot realize your potential as a leader without a keen awareness of personal and professional weaknesses and strengths. To help you develop that awareness and chart an intentional path for your leadership development, you need a clear strategy. Your long-term leadership development strategy is a document that assesses your strengths and weaknesses as a person and a leader (from your and others’ perspectives), clarifies your vision and values, and sets goals for the future. Your Long-term LD Strategy is limited to SIX (6) double-spaced pages of text (cover page, appendices, and your 6-month Action Plan are not included in this page limit).\n   2. **Short-term LD Plan.** Two things will catalyze and enable your long-term development strategy as well as course-correct you when you stray from your goals: (1) a near-time, actionable plan, and (2) a schedule pulse-check as to where you are against your plan. To enable these, there is a one-page template to help you think through and explicitly detail your 6-month Action Plan, which includes how and when you will reassess your progress against your development goals.\n   3. **Leadership Legacy Final Slide(s).**\n\n      Acknowledging that we each juggle a lot, there are two deadlines for this paper, you will self-select your preferred based upon how you would like to manage your commitments and time, as well as when you need your course grade submitted.\n5. **Class Citizenship, Contribution, & Professionalism.** Your contribution grade will be based on your *active* and *thoughtful* participation. Participation is more than asking and responding to questions—it also includes evidence of preparation for class and active participation in discussions. For each class session, you should be prepared to summarize or talk about an assigned reading, describe your paper, answer questions posed by other students, etc. Regardless of whether I am lecturing, we are engaging in group activities or discussions, guest lecturers are presenting, or your classmates are interjecting their ideas, I expect that you will actively listen, comment, solicit the viewpoints of others, etc. You have relevant personal experiences that can benefit the collective. I encourage you to share these during class and breakout discussions. Participation will be assessed in three ways at the end of the course: (1) Instructor Assessment, (2) Peer Assessment via Peer Evaluations, and (3) Self-Assessment.\n\n#### Attendance Requirement & Penalties\n\nBy enrolling in this course, you are agreeing to attend all synchronous sessions. Because the course is compressed and requires students to be active participants, you should not enroll unless you are able to attend each of the sessions. Attendance at all sessions is required. If you miss a session for any reason, your final grade in the course will be dropped by one full letter grade.\n\n#### Make-up for Missed Attendance, Assignments, & Exams\n\nPlease review the [university policy on make-up work](https://z.umn.edu/policy-makeup_work).\n\n#### Written Assignments\n\n* *Class writing assignments are intentionally short. Thus, careful writing matters even more. I suggest jotting down all the points you want to make and organizing them into a coherent “story” prior to writing. For each sentence and each paragraph, ask yourself, “What am I trying to communicate?” and then do so directly, clearly, and with carefully chosen words. Be clear about what you want to communicate and then choose clear language to communicate your ideas.* Remember: the essence of good writing is re-writing so spend time developing your assignments.\n* *Two things differentiate excellent papers from acceptable ones: (1) carefully following the assignment details; and (2) providing concrete, observable specifics, especially when describing experiences, strengths, or weaknesses. General statements are best followed by specific examples.*\n* *To enable you to meet all of these criteria, I have posted strong examples of final papers from past years if you need some inspiration, ideas on structure, or insights on depth.*\n\n**Written assignments will be graded based on:**\n\n* ***Creativity and insight*****:** Material presented is original, engaging, and interesting.\n* ***Integration with course readings, lectures, and discussions*****:** Paper draws on, applies, and seeks to extend leadership development concepts covered in the class.\n* ***Depth of*** ***analysis*****:** Paper demonstrates thorough attention to the issues of the situation and not just obvious extensions or surface treatment of the material. *Campbell tip: this is where I typically see the most points lost. Think deeply, write, then review and revise.*\n* ***Organization and structure*****:** Paper employs a logical framework and analyzes a critical issue.\n* ***Style*****:** Paper is well written using appropriate grammar, spelling, and punctuation.\n\n**Additional notes on assignments**\n\n* + *Any late work will have a grade reduced by one grade per day late (e.g. a paper one day late would drop from A to A-, two days late from A to B+).*\n  + *If you wish to dispute any grade, you must do so in writing within one week of when the paper was returned. Include a specific rationale for why you are disputing the grade.*\n\n### Graduate Carlson Grading Guidelines\n\nCarlson School uses a grading policy based upon a class median aggregate GPA. Learn more about the [Carlson Course Grading Policy.](https://z.umn.edu/policy-carlson_graduate_grading)\n\n### A Special Note\n\nBecause of our current national and political realities in the U.S., the challenging and complex international wars, and the fact that leadership is our central focus, it seems especially important to remind us of what ***academic freedom*** and the accompanying ***academic responsibility*** mean:\n\nAcademic freedom is the ***cornerstone*** of a university. At the University of Minnesota, as elsewhere, it means the freedom to explore all avenues of scholarship, research, and creative expression, and to speak or write on matters of public concern. Academic freedom includes the freedom to discuss all matters relevant to a course and may include presentation and/or discussion of diverse viewpoints on controversial matters. Students are responsible for learning the content of any course in which they enroll, and ***the learning process may include discussion about and reflection on varying points of view***.\n\nAlong with this freedom ***comes the responsibility to exercise academic freedom respectfully and to show consideration for the academic freedom of others***. Students and instructors should expect their views to be challenged, and everyone—students and instructors alike—has the obligation to be respectful, fair, and civil to others when discussing divergent points of view. Academic freedom and academic responsibility are taken seriously at the University of Minnesota. Students are encouraged to contact the instructor, the department chair, their adviser, or the campus student-conflict resolution office or center if they have questions or concerns.\n\n### Carlson & University Policies\n\n#### Academic Misconduct and Scholastic Dishonesty\n\nThe Carlson School defines academic misconduct as any act by a student that misrepresents the student's own academic work or that compromises the academic work of another. Scholastic misconduct includes (but is not limited to) cheating on assignments or examinations, plagiarizing, i.e., misrepresenting as one's own work any work done by another, submitting the same paper or substantially similar papers, to meet the requirement of more than one course without the approval and consent of the instructors concerned, or sabotaging another's work. Within this general definition, however, instructors determine what constitutes academic misconduct in the courses they teach. Students found guilty of academic misconduct face penalties ranging from lowering of the course grade or awarding a grade of F or N for the entire course, to suspension from the University.\n\nReview the [Student Conduct Code](https://z.umn.edu/policy-carlson_student_conduct_code) and [Student Conduct and Academic Integrity website](https://z.umn.edu/student_conduct_academic_integrity).\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about how to cite sources and avoid plagiarism, U of M libraries offers online [tutorials and tools related to citations](https://z.umn.edu/research_citation_tools). You can also visit the [Center for Writing](https://z.umn.edu/center_for_writing) for additional assistance.\n\n#### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities\n\nThe University of Minnesota is committed to providing all students equal access to learning opportunities. \nThe Disability Resource Center (DRC) is the campus office that works with students who have disabilities to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations. Students registered with the DRC who have a letter requesting accommodations are encouraged to contact the instructor early in the semester. Students who have, or think they may have, a disability (e.g. psychiatric, attention, learning, vision, hearing, physical, or systemic), are invited to contact the DRC for a confidential discussion at 612-626-1333 (V/TTY) or at [drc@umn.edu](mailto:drc@umn.edu). Additional information is available on the [Disability Resource Center website](https://z.umn.edu/disability_resource_center).\n\n#### Title IX\n\n[Title IX](https://z.umn.edu/title_ix_process) prohibits sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and relationship violence, in education.\n\n#### Mental Health and Stress Management\n\nAs a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student's ability to participate in daily activities. University of Minnesota services are available to assist you with addressing these and other concerns you may be experiencing. Learn more about the broad range of confidential [mental health services](https://z.umn.edu/mental_health_services) available on campus.\n\n#### Writing Support\n\nAs a student, you may experience challenges in your writing. The University of Minnesota has a [student writing support resource](https://z.umn.edu/student_writing_support) to help with your writing.\n\n#### Additional University Policies\n\n1.

Below are several strong exemplar papers. So that you can clearly understand how to structure your paper and how it will be evaluated, I have written a detailed overview, which also contains the grading rubric: [Final Leadership Development Plan.pdf](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/544866/files/57964863?verifier=f4zBmXniokoomJ9p7lysoD4UyqhMjX0gD5htzV50&wrap=1 \"Final Leadership Development Plan.pdf\")\n\nPlease upload your Final Leadership Development Paper as one document. Part C (leadership legacy slides) can be included in that document or uploaded separately (i.e., as PDF or PPT). I have enabled you to upload two documents.\n\n*Note: In prior terms, there was a Time-Use Assessment and a corresponding write-up/analysis.

Are there aspects of your leadership style that impact both your strengths and weaknesses?\n\n***Note: Stay in the present and detail where you are right now. Avoid judging yourself and thinking about where you “should be.” Instead, focus on identifying where you are right now regarding the leadership practices.***\n\nPlease take time to understand the assignment submission details. Do **NOT** write your reflection as a Google Doc and submit a link.\n", "metadata": {"course_folder": "MGMT6465-2026-SP__canvas_544866", "course_id": "MGMT6465", "doc_type": "assignment", "title": "2.

Please do this first—and start ASAP. This serves as the backbone of our course and will guide you through a self-assessment of your leadership behaviors. You must have at least six other individuals complete a survey about your behaviors. You may invite as many people as you wish, but six respondents reflect the minimum. **Not all respondents will respond, so I encourage you to invite at least eight (more is better).** I recommend that you invite a diverse set of colleagues—anyone who has had the opportunity to observe your behavior in a group, team, or leadership situation (e.g., current job, project teams, coaches, mentors, perhaps past jobs, volunteer or service organizations, or others who have had the opportunity to observe your work behaviors). If you have direct reports, ask them first. You will definitely want their feedback. You should also consider asking peers and your manager(s). I leave it to your judgment as to which individuals can best help sharpen your awareness of your current leadership style and skills. The only criterion is that they have had the opportunity to observe your leadership and influence behaviors—remember, engaging in leadership behaviors does not require having formal authority.\n\nLike all high-quality 360-degree leadership assessments, there is a cost associated with the assessment ($160, which already reflects a 20% off UMN rate I negotiated). I understand that this is not cheap! Accordingly, I was mindful of cost when selecting the remainder of the required assessments/textbooks/materials and chose/developed free versions of other exercises and assessments. And because you are paying for this assessment, please make the most of it by getting started early and inviting ample respondents. Get your money’s worth!\n\nDetails for this assignment and how to sign up online for the assessment are attached. **Read the below instructions carefully and pay careful attention to the highlighted PIN and promo code, which links your assessments to our class.** Once you sign up, complete your assessment and select respondents immediately. This process, including your own self-assessment takes only about 10-20 minutes. I encourage you to do it when you have a little bit of headspace to reflect on your own behaviors and style—**as you *are*, not as you think you *should be***. Note: I will gently remind your observers who have yet to complete the assessment by their deadline.\n\n*[LPI 360 – Step by Step Setup Guide, Spring 2026 - UPDATED (Feb 1).docx](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/544866/files/59433000?wrap=1 \"LPI 360 – Step by Step Setup Guide, Spring 2026 - UPDATED (2:1).docx\")*\n\n*(We will record your on-time completion for your grade)*\n", "metadata": {"course_folder": "MGMT6465-2026-SP__canvas_544866", "course_id": "MGMT6465", "doc_type": "assignment", "title": "1.A LPI 360 (self-assessment & choose raters; Due: Thursday, 2/5, 11:59pm CT)", "source_url": "https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/544866/assignments/5027429", "canvas_course_id": 544866, "canvas_assignment_id": 5027429, "page_url": null, "updated_at": "2026-02-01T20:23:15Z", "due_at": "2026-02-06T05:59:59Z", "linked_from_module": true, "module_name": "Consolidated View of Key Assignments", "canvas_module_id": 2590047, "module_item_type": "Assignment", "module_item_id": 15705737, "module_item_position": 2, "module_item_published": null, "exported_html": "html/assignments/5027429__1.A LPI 360 self-assessment  choose raters Due Thursday 25 1159pm CT.html", "converted_md": "md/assignments/5027429__1.A LPI 360 self-assessment choose raters Due Thursday 25 1159pm CT.md"}}

The more thoughtful your reflection and answers, the more likely it is that these thought exercises will help you plan and write your final Leadership Development Plan.*\n\n*You should share and capture in prose (or bullet points) what best serves you. Prompts are to encourage growth without pushing you to share more than you want.  Using GenAI on prompts would be an \"interesting choice\"—if an individual were outsourcing their introspection and leadership development to a robot, would you hire them? GPT might hire them, but you shouldn't.*\n\n**1. Identify a daring failure**. Think of a time you put yourself out there, and it didn’t work (work or personal). Briefly capture: (a) What you attempted and why it mattered; b) What the outcome was; c) How you responded in the moment (what you did/said next), and d) One lesson you’d want your future self to remember (and one behavior you’d repeat or change next time)\n\n**2. Audit your perceived constraints.** (“We can’t because…”). List the likely “We can’t do this because…” statements that could constrain your project/work (e.g., time, staffing, politics, risk, priorities, stakeholders, capabilities). Write 5-7 statements as they would realistically be said out loud.\n\n**3. Reality check (+ / –)**. Now, go back through your list and mark each statement:\n\n* (+) actually true/hard constraint (at least for now)\n* (–) not fully true, uncertain, or challengeable\n  *(If helpful: add (?) for “I don’t know yet”)*\n\n**4. Challenge your assumptions and surface potential solutions.** Choose 2–3 “–” statements to challenge (turn constraints into experiments). For the 2–3 most important challengeable constraints, write:\n\n* The statement: “We can’t because \\_\\_\\_.”\n* The hidden assumption underneath it: “This assumes \\_\\_\\_.”\n* A better question to replace it: “How might we \\_\\_\\_ despite \\_\\_\\_?”\n* One small experiment you could run to test it (a conversation, pilot, prototype, data check, stakeholder ask)\n\n**5. Commit (next ~14 days).** Choose one experiment from above that you will actually run in the next two weeks. Specify: a) What you’ll do + when; b) Who you’ll involve (or who you’ll ask); c) The 1–2 questions you’ll ask; and d) How you’ll capture what you learn (3 bullets, notes, voice memo).\n", "metadata": {"course_folder": "MGMT6465-2026-SP__canvas_544866", "course_id": "MGMT6465", "doc_type": "assignment", "title": "REFLECTION EXERCISE: Daring Greatly", "source_url": "https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/544866/assignments/5027443", "canvas_course_id": 544866, "canvas_assignment_id": 5027443, "page_url": null, "updated_at": "2026-02-04T18:39:53Z", "due_at": "2026-02-14T16:00:00Z", "linked_from_module": true, "module_name": "Day 2 (Feb 14th & 15th)", "canvas_module_id": 2590044, "module_item_type": "Assignment", "module_item_id": 15705692, "module_item_position": 18, "module_item_published": null, "exported_html": "html/assignments/5027443__REFLECTION EXERCISE Daring Greatly.html", "converted_md": "md/assignments/5027443__REFLECTION EXERCISE Daring Greatly.md"}}
